CHAPTER XXX.

THE BEGINNING OF MYSTERY.

An unusual number of patients were gathered around
some object of interest in the men's ward, which ordi-
narily was well-nigh deserted in tlie middle of the day.
As John drew near the group, but one voice was distin-
guishable and that was speaking as follows :

"There was a man out in Lenawee had a bunch on his
neck like that, only it was on the left side instead of the
right. He'd been here, and he'd been to one of these
traveling doctors that tucks his advertisements and his
pictures in the papers. Get help ? Of course he didn't
get any help. Then, after he'd tried everything else, 1
sold him a bottle of panacea. 1 told him to put it on
three days and then leave it off three days. The first
three days the bunch got soft. The next three days it
commenced to go away. When he put on the medicine,
it softened it up, but it wouldn't start to go away until he
quit putting it on. Just as soon as he quit, it would go
down a little, and after three days it would get hard again.
There was something strange about that. He kept on
that way a month, and his neck was cured, and it never
bothered him again. The next time I saw him he w?s
practicing lifting things with his teeth. He had a leather
fastened to a barrel of cider, and he'd churn the barrel
up and down. He talked of practicing up to go with a
show. I didn't hear, though, whether he did or not."

"I don't give a continental for the strengthening part,"
said the New Yorker. "All I care about is to take the
bunch off,"

"That's what this w'l' do," said Panicky, for it was
indeed he. "HcIIq^ J" he exclaimed, as he espied John
moving avf^y on hi??? crutches. "I'd like to see you a

minute. Will you wait till I get through talking with this
man ? "

"Yes," responded John, who had intended to slip from
the hospital unobserved. ,

"I'll be through here directly," said Panicky, "now,
if this don't give perfect satisfaction, you can bring it
back."

"You seem to be in very bad shape," observed
Panicky, to a man who was blowing his nose.

"Yes," answered the patient, "Tm in bad shape.
I've got the catarrh, and I guess I always will have it."

"Oh no, you won't," answered Panicky, "not if you
doctor it right. Three weeks is all I ask to cure that in."

"Three weeks," echoed the sufferer, "you're wild.
You're just talking to sell."

"I'll tell you why I think so," Said Panicky, "and after
I've explained it, you'll think as I do. The panacea re-
duces unnatural growths. That is what it is designed
expressly for. Now, I wouldn't advise that man with the
scrofula to use it, for it wouldn't help him a bit. This
is on the same principle as taking off a swelling, you see,
bringing the blood-vessels down to their normal size and
destroying inflammation and clearing the nasal passages."

"Oh, I don't hardly think it would help me," said the
man with the catarrh.

"I've cured eleven cases of catarrh this summer,"
assured Panicky. "Now, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you
get sick of your bargain, I'll take the medicine back any
time."

"That's fair enough," said the patient after a sneeze.
"I'll take a bottle, but I don't have much hope that it
will help me."

"Come along this way," said Panicky, grabbing his
satchels and hurrying to John. "I see a doctor coming,"
he explained as they left the hospital. "If he should see
me in there and know what I was doing, he wouldn't like
it. These doctors act as though nobody knew any med-
icine but themselves. They caught me in there once,
and they made an awful fuss. Now, I come down here
on purpose after you, I thought I might as well sell a little
medicine while I was here."



284 THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK O' DA V.

ployed to pronounce a funeral oration. "You said we
could return the medicine when we wanted to."

"And I kept my agreement," responded the vendor of
medicine. '* You returned them, and I took them back
like a man."

"It don't seem to me as though that's hardly right,"
said the man with the catarrh in an aggrieved tone.

For a moment the New Yorker was speechless. Then
the veins stood out alongside the bunch on his neck and
he cried, "Oh, you whelp. If you wasn't right here in
the city, I'd smash you fine."

"We expected you would refund the money," said the
catarrhal sufferer.

"Now, that would be unreasonable," returned Panicky,
** unless there was such an understanding. I said I would
take them back, and that's what I've done. I wouldn't
wonder if you'd better keep your medicine. It may save
your lives," he added, placing the bottles on the side-
walk and leaving his dissatisfied customers.

There was a clink of broken glass. The New Yorker
had dyed the paving-stones with Great American
Panacea.

"What a waste," remarked Panicky to John. "That
might have preserved a human life that just as like as
not will be lost now. How lame that horse is. I wonder
what is the matter with him ? "

Panicky joined John immediately after his repulse by
the teamster. His strides were so rapid that his crippled
companion was soon left in the rear. "Can't you let out
a notch or two ?" he said. "We ought to be getting
around."

"We could get along faster if we took a more even
pace," returned John. "We walk five minutes and stop
fifty."

"That can't be helped," said Panicky. ** I have got my
work to do for the good of my race, and it must be done.
Sun, calm, wind, rain, snow or hail, I must travel and give
help to the afflicted. When we stop I'll let you have a
bottle of the panacea for your foot. I don't like to see a
man limp that way."

"Where are you going to take me ?" asked John.



286 THE CHRONICLES OE BREAK O* DA Y.

From this place to the journey's end John hardly looked
out of his car window.

"Come on, young man," said Panicky, as they stopped
at Lansing.

The surroundings of the depot were far from pleasing.
Before it was a willow swamp, which long lumber piles
and a manufactory made of brick, which a high, smoke-
blackened chimney, did not hide. The richest part of the
city, whose roofs and steeples alone were visible, lay to
the westward.

Small groups of citizens stood in front of the
passengerhouse. A pair of trucks with "Phoenix Mills" labeled
on the box was passing alongside the railroad track through
a cut. From a car on a side-track a good-natured looking
man was loading stove-wood into a wagon with a high box,
on which was inscribed the name of the commodity which
it was designed to carry. A wheeze from the old horse
by which the wagon was drawn instantly brought Panicky
to the spot.

"How do you do," said the peddler. "Bad cough that
horse has."

"Yes," answered the teamster, without stopping his
work an instant. "He's got the heaves."

"I know what will fix that in a hurry," said Panicky.
"Cobb's Concentrated Carbolic Cough Killer will kill any
cough that a horse ever had."

"I don't hardly think I'll buy to-day," said the teamster,
as if he disliked to wound the feelings of the patent
medicine man.

"If you use it once, you'll never be without it," said the
peddler. "Coughs, wheezing, running at the nose, colds,
animal influenza, distemper, heaves, none of them can
stand before the cough killer."

"It seems to me my brother got some of that for his
boss," said the teamster, still throwing the wood into the
wagon.

** Then you've found out it's a grand thing," said Panicky.
"Didn't it kill the cough ? "

"Well, no, not exactly," returned the teamster, straight-
ening up. "Killed the boss, though."

"Very lamentable, very," remarked Panicky, as he



THE CffRONfCLES OF BREAK C DA Y. 287

grabbed his satchels and started southward along the rail-
road track, followed by John. He had gone but a few rods
when he riveted his gaze on a robust appearing fellow who
was going toward the main part of the city.

"Must we stop again ?" asked John. "Take me to my
destination and then sell as much medicine as you like.''

"Young man," replied the peddler severely, "you are
too narrow-minded. You think the world was made for
you and your petty concerns. You must broaden out and
get sympathy for humanity."

The track ran through a piece of high ground which
descended to the west. The hillside at the east, covered
with scraggy brush, stood out in bold relief ; but the view
at the right was limited, because of its swift descent to the
hidden river and the low elevation of Che track. Scattered
along on the small rises of ground which overlooked the
stream, were diminutive cottages, of which a few were
painted. Before one of these little buildings a smooth-
faced old man wearing a Scotch cap was bent low, cut-
ting stove-wood with a dull buck-saw.

"That's hard business," remarked Panicky.

"There ain't nothin' easy about it," said the wood-saw-
yer, suspending his work.

"Don't you sometimes get tired ? "

"Yes, real. Sometimes I'm purty near played. I used
to be so I could stand it tol'able well, but late years 1
ain't so full o' besum."

"I noticed that before I got anywhere near you."

"You talk as if you knowed !" exclaimed the old man
in astonishment.

"I do. You can't fool me much about a man. Don't
your back ache some ? "

"Yes, yes," said the wood-sawyer, his wonder increas-
ing.

"And when you stoop over, it's a good deal worse ;
and if you stoop over long, you can't stand it and have to
straighten up, and then it'll get better for a while. But in
the morning, the day after you've worked hard, it's worse
than it is any other time."



288 THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK O' DA V.

"No," answered the peddler," I know more about it
than a doctor.''

** Do you think it's anything particular ? "

"Yes, it's deficient vigor in the back. Muscles lax,
spinal column imperfectly sustained.' It will keep getting
worse and worse until it finally downs you."

"Danged if I ain't a gittin' worried," said the old man,
letting go of his buck-saw. "Don't you s'pose I'll ever
i cure it ? "

I "It ain't at all likely," returned Panicky. "You'll probably
be a cripple and linger along for some years. But
you mustn't be discouraged. You ought to be ready to
die when your time comes."

"I know I orto be ready. But the lingerin*, I don't
like that 'ere. What 'ud you do for this back bizness if
, it was on you ? "

??? "I should cure it, if it was on me."

"I thought you said there wa'n't no cure for it."

"Oh, no, I thought you'd be apt to let it run until
there wasn't any hope for you."

"What 'ud you take for it, anyhow ? "

"I should take Great American Panacea and cure it in
three weeks."

"Where could a feller git a bottle o' that 'ere stuif ? "

"I've got a bottle I'll sell you for a dollar if you want
it."

** Oh, you're a sellin' of it," exclaimed the oid man, a
light suddenly breaking in on his dull understanding, '* I
don't believe I want none. Times is hard with me."

"You better take a bottle. Mister," urged Panicky.

I " You'll never regret it. I knew a man out in Oakland

; County "

all Spain. There you see the directions are in Spanish
and English, too."

"I don't want none on it," said the old man,

"Just as like as not, the trouble is in your kidneys," re-
naarked Panicky. " Your complexion looks like it. For
kidney disorders there never was anything could hold a
candle to Wakefield's Honey of Mullein and Sage."

"I ain't a-hankerin' to take no mullein nor sage," said
the old man. " My mother she give me sage tea when I
was a little chap, till I got clean degusted with it- I
smoked mullein, tryin' to give up tobaccer, an' I ain't
crazy for mullein no more. I won't buy no medicine to-
day."

"I know what will cure you," exclaimed the peddler.
"You need a bottle of Great Wangamyika Discovery."

"Now, I wouldn't wonder an there was smhin' in that,"
said the old man, impressed by the peculiar orthography
of the name.

"It's a great thing," said Panicky, " and no mistake.
There was an African chief, he was a great fellow to fight,
and he'd always fight with a club. Once, when he was
having a battle with another tribe, he got a lick in the
back that about used him up. He couldn't run and he
couldn't swing his war-club. That was what bothered
him the worst. Every morning he'd get up and see if he
couldn't fetch the war-club around, but it wasn't any use.
His enemies commenced to press him on every side, and
as he couldn't fight, of course his men got whipped.
This kept up quite a while, and at last he didn't have
much of any territory left. He said if he could onfy get
out himself and fight he could drive them back in short
order. He got all the big medicine men in his kingdom
to prescribe for him, but his back grew worse, instead of
better. By and by he lost his patience entirely, and he
said if they didn't relieve him inside of six months, off
would go their heads.

"That set 'em to thinking. They come together and
consulted. The first thing they done was to take some
slaves and lame 'em, as near as they could like the chief.
One of 'em practiced up till he could hit the right kind of
a wallop every time. The slaves they'd squirm around
'9



ago THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK C DA Y.

and yell, but nobody would pay any attention to 'em.

The medicine men Ihey fussed and fussed till they got
discouraged. They'd think a patient was on the gain,
when he'd up and die. They'd try five kinds of medicine,
and six, and eight, and twelve. They'd try half of one
kind and a twentieth of the rest, and a tenth of three or
four and different .parts of a lot of others.

"About two weeks before the timd was up, one of the
slaves got well. They fixed the chief up a few doses of
the same stufi, and he was swinging his war-club as well
as he ever did. He got so he could throw it in a curve
around one of his men and hit an enemy. His back
grew so stout that he didn't like a light club any more.
He had a heavy one mr.de' that nobody else could fetch
around in any kind of shape. There never was another
such a fellow to shake a war-club in Africa. A week after
he was cured he went out against the Maleovajaws, beat
'em and took their king prisoner. He let the medicine
men practice up on the prisoners, hitting 'em in the back
and curing 'em. He give 'em directions that they should
never let anybody know the secret of the medicine. One
of 'em did, though, told a missionary when he was dying.
The missionary thought folksin this country ought to have
it. He went all over Africa to gather the herbs, and sent
'em here. He named it Great Wangamyika discovery."

"This 'ere Great Wanagam cured the chief purty quick,
did it?" inquired the old man.

"Ves," answered Panicky, "very quick. There seems
to be something about it that's specially good for the back.
Affinity they call it for the spinal cord and the vertebrae,"

"I'll have a bottle if it busts me," said the old man.
"Hand it over."

Panicky instructed his customer how to use the medi-
cine. He must rub it in thoroughly, half of the time
stroking downward and half crosswise.

John and his companion soon came in sight of the
river ; and after crossing the railroad bridge, turned to the
right and followed the stream, leaving it, however, when
they had reached jhe next street which led to the left.
The ftouses ???ere here better, and the view in general was

"How much farther have we to go ? " asked John.

"We're about there now," said Panicky, "that house
right ahead,"

It was a noble-looking structure which had been indi-
cated by the peddler. Whether the walls were of stone
or of brick, John, wiio knew little of architecture, could
not determine. An upright and a wing, on a rise of
ground too gradual and low to be called a hill, it was, sav-
ing its preponderance of length,



One of the most efficient aids in giving it an aspect of



292 THE CHRONICLES Op BREAK O' DA V.

"So I have," said Durgenson. " So I have. Til sat-
isfy you on that point to-night. I can't explain now. I'm
in a great hurry."

A woman rushed from the porch and interrupted John
in his departure.

"Stop," she cried. " I want to see you."
. " Maybe you'd better go in," said Durgenson.

The woman led John through a hall, through another
room and into a smaller apartment, in which she left
him.

"Stay here a moment," she said, locking the door as
she went. ???

On ordinary occasions John would have been quick to
rebel against a curtailment of his liberty, but he was now
so anxious to hear the expected revelation that he sub-
mitted with good grace.

** This way," said the woman, again peering into the
room.

John, with his expectations aroused to the highest pitch,
went up a flight of stairs and into a small room as his
guide indicated.

"Wait here until I call for you," said the woman, turn-
ing the key in the Jock.

The house was still, and the room, lighted only by one
window, was comparatively dark. As time passed curi-
osity gave place to loneliness, and loneliness to unrest.

John's dissatisfaction with his quarters increased. Mrs.
Boyle's neglected warning to avoid Durgenson, coupled
with the suspicious conduct of the woman who had con-
ducted him to the chamber, intensified his sense of in-
security.

While he was deliberating whether to cry out and de-
mand release, or to attempt an escape from the window,
there came from below a voice, which, low but resonant,
filled him with a singular awe.

"Has the Suebian come ? "

led him from the scene of the fire. The repeated blows
which he had received had deadened sensation, and he
had neither concern for the present nor anxiety for the
future. At intervals he passed his palm across his brow,
generally repeating the act before he dropped his hand.

His face and hands were blistered in places, and his
hair adhered to his head in singed clusters, his eyes
were inflamed, and the lashes burned nearly off.

"You are badly burned. Uncle James," said Manie,
who was crying. " How it must hurt you."

ranted cutting of the timber was discovered. As the fall
of the tree did not frighten the coon from his refuge, Jake
cut into the body, which in that place was but a shell.
He was both surprised and chagrined when the ax struck
a metallic substance which took from it a deep nick.

"What blamed fool has been a-stuffin' an auger in
here?" he exclaimed, pulling the designated tool from
its place of secretion. His astonishment increased as he
drew out some clothes and, lastly, a long pocket-book,
which, upon examination, he saw contained a large roll of
bills. He thought at once of the robbery in July, and, for-
getting the coon, started for Mrs. Green's house. Owing
to the deafness of Mrs. Green and the timidity of William
Henry Harrison, who never quite recovered from his ter-
ror of the midnight visitor by whom his master had been
slain, Sheppard was some time in securing an answer to
his knocks and calls. Mrs. Green, however, was at last
aroused by the half-wit, who broke the fastening to her
bedroom door and entered her room for protection, Jake
went to her window, made known his errand, and was ad-
mitted to the house. The only reward which he received
from the widow was forgiveness for his depredation in
her timber. Shortly after this event he called at the cot-
tage by .the church and left an envelope directed to the
major. The envelope contained fifty dollars in currency
and a badly spelled note which stated that Sheppard was
going away from the neighborhood and begged that Ratke
would accept the money as a token of regard.

The major rallied in part from the stupor which chained
him in the few days succeeding (he lire. He made an
auction, and sold his personal property. When Taylor was
taken away by a Jackson horseman, who bought him for
four hundred dollars, Ratke with sadness watched the
handsome animal, trotting behind the owner's sulky as he
was led up the road. He paid first his hired men, with
the exception of Sheppard, who could not be found. The
remainder of his money he distributed among his credi-
tors, who were numerous. Most of them were content to
allow him lime for his fortunes to mend, but a few gave
warning that, unless payment was speedily made, they
would cause him trouble. This insulting language re-

tion, but her ruse was unavailing. He did not noiice
them until they were alluded to by his sister, when he
picked them up, apparently without interest, and threw
them down with a sigh.

Manie, although she was obliged to do all the wprk in
the family of Osborne, who had seven children and one
hired man, on being informed of her uncle's dangerous
apathy came home every night and returned in the
morning. Ratke showed the first pleasure which he
had exhibited for weeks. No matter how tired he was,
when he had finished his toil for the day, he walked up
the road to meet her. His object was not to talk, nor
did it seem to be to hear her, for he wa.s an indifferent
listener. Satisfied with her presence, he desired no ex-
change of words. His instinct to be near her was like
that of the d<^ which silently follows Jiis master, or that
of the dying horse which, when turned loose that he may
have room to struggle, totters back to breathe his last in
his familiar stall. Vears before, he had told her stories
while she had sat on his knee and combed his hair.
Now he had childishly asked her to do again as she had
done then. She humored his whim, and it was seldom
that he had to remind her of his wish.

Mrs. Green, who wailed until after seeding to thresh
her grain, one day dispatched William- Henry Harrison
to secure Ratke's assistance. The next morning the
major with his pitchfork appeared early at the house of
his old enemy. He was given a place on the bundle
stack, but through the intervention of his friend, Jim
Turner, he was allowed the easy duty of holding bags.
At noon Jim was obliged to leave on account of a
previous promise which he had made to Osborne.

William Henry Harrison, Sparks and Wingscheut w.re
on the straw-stack. Throughout the forenoon the half-
wit had worked by the carrier, in the language of Wings-
cheut, "vith his mouth vite open ketchin, all te chaff."
After dinner the maior noticed the poor fellow toilinc



THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK o'Day. 299

"Come down here, William Henry Harrison," called
Ratke, " I will ciiange with you. You can hold bags."

The major took the position which had been occupied
by the half-wit, who slid down the stack and was buried
in the litterings at the bottom, from which he soon
emerged. Sparks motioned to the feeder, with whom, on
the night of the expedition to Wallace's, the major had
quarreled over the disposition of the horse-thieves in
case they were captured. The driver, in turn, received
the signal from the feeder, the horses bent their heads
and tugged, the machine sang more loudly, and every
man about it bestirred himself anew. The straw rolled
in great masses up the carrier, to the head of which a
suffocating cloud of dust was borne by the wind.

The major, whose temper and dignity were aroused,
stood at his post, too proud to ask for relief. The straw
gathered in a wall behind him, and Wingscheut lazily or
purposely let it fall back, so that he was obliged to
pitch back large quantities of it the second time. At
each one of the huge forkfuls which he had to take his
body trembled, and he wondered how much longer he
could endure the strain. Most of the hands were busily
occupied, and those who were not bestowed little sympathy
on the old man in his weakness so heroically and piti-
fully trying to keep up an appearance of strength. He
was at the point of exhaustion, when the threshing was
finished and the machine suspended motion. Without
waiting for his supper or his coat and vest, which, of course,
he had stripped off, he went away from the barn-yard,
his breathing difficult, his eyes blinded and his face
blackened with dirt.

"Guess Jerusalem got about enough," said the Oakville
man, loud enough for Ratke to hear, " I ain't sorry
neither. It ain't any worse for him to work than it is for
me."

"This ain't makin' wagons," remarked Sparks.

The words rankled deep in the majors breast, as with

but now, removed from his defenses, he could not en-
dure it.

Mrs. Gnppin had gone to visit Mrs. Boyle, with whom
she expected to stay that night. Manie, who had finished
her work for Osborne, received her uncle with expressions
of pity. She brought some wafer and washed the dirt
from his face and neck. While she was combing the chafE
from his hair, a constable came to serve a summons on
him in behalf of the Empire Machine Company.

"The completion of disgrace," said Ratke, after the
man had gone. " I cannot pay them. Judgment will be
rendered against me, and 1 must have it thrown in my
teeth that my promises are lies. How much more ! Oh,
God, how much more can I endure I "

"Let me comb the chaff from your hair," said Manie.

"No," answered the major, taking his hat and going
out of the house. He went straight to the little black-
smith shop and stood before it. The sun, now a reddish
ball, stripped of its fiery spikes, seemed lying in a slight
depression of the landscape, as if it had rolled thither
from one of the declivities between which it rested. Its
latest rays were permitted to fall on Ratke by the parting
of a strip of cloud, which was drawn asunder like curtains
on a stage. The major's gaze rested longest on the build-


bound him to them anew. What would Manie say when
she saw his uncle and heard him give his affectionate re-
gards to his nephew "Johnny "? Had he known, as he stood
before the hospital, the vexatious surprise which awaited
him, he could have turned from it and gone his way. He
thought now of leaving the city, but he concluded to wait
until the operation had been performed.

"Johnny," said Wrengell, "you didn't tell me whether
you'd ever lived in Branch or not."

"Let us take a walk," said John, not wishing his com-
panion's speculations to be overheard.

"All right," responded Wrengell, "that'll please me.
Where had we better go now, to the museum ? "

"No, I do not care to go there," answered John.

"We can just walk then," said Wrengell. "I ain't par-
ticular. I've seen everything they have there anyway. I
didn't know but you might have some curiosity. 1 see
you don't think we're any relation."

"I suppose every member of the human family is
related to every other member," replied John. "If we
could trace it to Adam, we might prove our relation-
ship."

"I can do it without," said Wrengell, with a pleased
look which made him appear particularly villainous, "I
know all about you, as much as a man ought to know
about his nephew. You lived with a man by the name of
Norris. He was in the township of Terry. I don't re-
member the section, but there's a swamp in the northeast
corner of his farm, a little swamp. Now, you won't say
you never picked huckleberries in that swamp,"

John was silent.

"I thoijii^ht yoii ivouldn'ti" said Wrengell. "You must
have heard Norris cpeak about your Uncle Arthur, Art,

"Now, Johnny, I feel as though I'd like to," said
Wrengell. "You will let your uncle do this for you, won't

John, disliking to wound Wrengell's feelings, accepted
the gift. His maimed foot made rapid progress toward
recovery. It was, no doubt, fortunate on account of his
sprained ankle, whicfi was not entirely well, that he was
for a season kept from stepping on his left foot. At times
the thought occurred to him that he might be followed
and identified as the suspected horse-thief who had fled
from Break o'Day. He had hesitated to give his real
name at the hospital, but the reported change of popular
sentiment in his favor and his aversion to adopting a sub-
terfuge which was worthy of his ignoble parentage induced
him to pursue the more open course.

One day in the hospital he was sitting in an arm-chair
by his bed. Near him was a man who had a hard bunch, ,
about as large as a walnut, on one side of his neck.

"This is (he dullest place I ever got info," was the ob-
servation of this latter individual, as he laid down a news-
paper with a yawn. "Read, mope, talk, walk around,
sleep, that's all there is to it. I don't see as I'm any bet-
ter than I was when I come. I come far enough so I
ourht to get help, from old Genesee County, New York,
They had good doctors there, first-rate. I wanted to try
them. But I'd heard a good deal about Ann Arbor. My
friends they kept harping, ' Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor. Go
to Ann Arbor. They can do big things to Ann Arbor.'
And now I've got here, I wish I was back. They had a
better doctor right there inBatavia; he's dead now, but
he was a better doctor than they've got in this whole in-
stitution. He could tell what was the matter with you as
quick as he saw you. These fellows don't know anything
about it. They only guess. They're just as apt to get it
wrong as right."

The dissatisfied New Yorker picked up his paper and
scanned a column which he had previously overlooked.

"Well, now," he exclaimed, "if these Michigan folks
don't beat all. Roughest set I ever see. Here's a man
.itoJe.some money ^o' ^'"^^ ^""^ "'^" went back and set a
big house afire.'



THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK o'Day, 2^]

"Where did that happen ?" asked John.

"Maybe you'd like to read it/' said the New Yorker,
handing John the paper.

John could hardly repress his excitement as he learned
the tragic story of Montcalm's death and the burning of
Ratke's house. He sincerely mourned Montcalm, and
his sympathy for the unfortunate family of the major was
unbounded. He tried, to smother the thought that the
event, so disastrous to his friends, had raised his prospect
of success merely by lowering the standard to which he
was aspiring. For this selfish consolation he detested
himself, and the remorse which he felt for harboring it
more than equaled the satisfaction which it afforded.

He immediately wrote a letter to Manie, expressing his
sorrow for their loss. Ignorant of the extent of the
major's misfortunes, he supposed that he would remain
on his farm where he would erect a new house. He was
now able to wear slippers and to walk about with the aid
of his crutches. Putting the letter, which was not yet
stamped, on the stand by his bed, he prepared to go to
the street.

"Going up town ? " queried Wrengell.


"Yes," said John.

"Guess I'll go too," said Wrengell, "if youVe no
objections. Maybe you think rather hard of me, Johnny,"
he began when they were on the sidewalk. " Of course
you've heard Norris tell something about me."

"I have heard something of you," said John.

"I reckoned likely," pursued Wrengell. " I've been
slandered. I was unfortunate, as he told you, of course,
and got behind the bars in Jackson. But, Johnny, I
wasn't guilty. I swear to you on my word of honor, the
word of hpnor of your uncle, I wasn't guilty. I don't
blame the jury nor the judge. My freedom was swore
away, and it was done by a fellow I'd helped a good deal.
Some things was took from a jewelry store in Detroit, that
wasn't a great ways from where I lived, just about four
blocks. It didn't worry me much when an officer arrested

me for it, for I knew I could prove my good character.
I said, * All right, sir, you won't keep me long.' I was a
little worried when they brought in the jewelry and said



ayS THE CHROmCLES OF BREAK & DA V.

they found it tucked away in my house. My lawyer said
to me, ' That looks bad, Wrengell. If you hadn't bore
an awful good character, you wouldn't never gel out of
this.'

'Let 'em work,' I said. ' My reputation is too good
for me to be hurt much. Anybody that knows Arthur
Wrengell knows he won't steal.' Why, I've had rich men,
the best men there was in Detroit and the most influen-
tial there was Zack Chandler, said to me, 'Wrengell, if I
had warning that I was going to die to-morrow, I'd will
my property to you and write you a note telling you how
I wanted it divided. I'd be sure you wouldn't keep a
cent.' But I was beat when Bill Weeks swore he met me
on the stairs in my house the night the things was stole.
I knew that settled it, and I might as well throw up the
sponge. I'd helped Bill to get the position he had as
clerk, and pushed him along every way i could. He was
intimate with my folks. The day I was arrested, it was
raining. He spent his money as fast as he earned it and
was hard up. He come aad wanted to borrow my rubber
coat. I didn't think but what he was all right, and I said,
'Go right upstairs and get it yourself, Bill.' He must
have left the things up there then.

"The jury brought in a verdict of guilty. The judge
didn't believe I took the things, but he had to sentence
me, according to the evidence. He was in tears when he
done it. Chandler, he was mad. He said it was the
biggest outrage he ever heard of. He worked a long
time, trying to get a pardon from the governor. When
he couldn't make it out, he told him it would be his last
term and so it was. Lots of folks wonder how the gover-
nor come to be defeated in the convention. Old Zack
can tell 'em, and so can I."

"I have forgotten my letter," said John. "I must go
back."

"That's bad, to have to make two trips," said Wrengell.
"You haven't heard from your father lately, Johnny ? "

"No," was John's brief answer.

"Neither have I," said Wrengell, "not for some years.

CHAPTER XXX.

THE BEGINNING OF MYSTERY.

An unusual number of patients were gathered around
some object of interest in the men's ward, which ordi-
narily was well-nigh deserted in tlie middle of the day.
As John drew near the group, but one voice was distin-
guishable and that was speaking as follows :

"There was a man out in Lenawee had a bunch on his
neck like that, only it was on the left side instead of the
right. He'd been here, and he'd been to one of these
traveling doctors that tucks his advertisements and his
pictures in the papers. Get help ? Of course he didn't
get any help. Then, after he'd tried everything else, 1
sold him a bottle of panacea. 1 told him to put it on
three days and then leave it off three days. The first
three days the bunch got soft. The next three days it
commenced to go away. When he put on the medicine,
it softened it up, but it wouldn't start to go away until he
quit putting it on. Just as soon as he quit, it would go
down a little, and after three days it would get hard again.
There was something strange about that. He kept on
that way a month, and his neck was cured, and it never
bothered him again. The next time I saw him he w?s
practicing lifting things with his teeth. He had a leather
fastened to a barrel of cider, and he'd churn the barrel
up and down. He talked of practicing up to go with a
show. I didn't hear, though, whether he did or not."

"I don't give a continental for the strengthening part,"
said the New Yorker. "All I care about is to take the
bunch off,"

"That's what this w'l' do," said Panicky, for it was
indeed he. "HcIIq^ J" he exclaimed, as he espied John
moving avf^y on hi??? crutches. "I'd like to see you a



THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK o'Day, 28 1

minute. Will you wait till I get through talking with this
man ? "

"Yes," responded John, who had intended to slip from
the hospital unobserved. ,

"I'll be through here directly," said Panicky, "now,
if this don't give perfect satisfaction, you can bring it
back."

"You seem to be in very bad shape," observed
Panicky, to a man who was blowing his nose.

"Yes," answered the patient, "Tm in bad shape.
I've got the catarrh, and I guess I always will have it."

"Oh no, you won't," answered Panicky, "not if you
doctor it right. Three weeks is all I ask to cure that in."

"Three weeks," echoed the sufferer, "you're wild.
You're just talking to sell."

"I'll tell you why I think so," Said Panicky, "and after
I've explained it, you'll think as I do. The panacea re-
duces unnatural growths. That is what it is designed
expressly for. Now, I wouldn't advise that man with the
scrofula to use it, for it wouldn't help him a bit. This
is on the same principle as taking off a swelling, you see,
bringing the blood-vessels down to their normal size and
destroying inflammation and clearing the nasal passages."

"Oh, I don't hardly think it would help me," said the
man with the catarrh.

"I've cured eleven cases of catarrh this summer,"
assured Panicky. "Now, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you
get sick of your bargain, I'll take the medicine back any
time."

"That's fair enough," said the patient after a sneeze.
"I'll take a bottle, but I don't have much hope that it
will help me."

"Come along this way," said Panicky, grabbing his
satchels and hurrying to John. "I see a doctor coming,"
he explained as they left the hospital. "If he should see
me in there and know what I was doing, he wouldn't like
it. These doctors act as though nobody knew any med-
icine but themselves. They caught me in there once,
and they made an awful fuss. Now, I come down here
on purpose after you, I thought I might as well sell a little
medicine while I was here."

ployed to pronounce a funeral oration. "You said we
could return the medicine when we wanted to."

"And I kept my agreement," responded the vendor of
medicine. '* You returned them, and I took them back
like a man."

"It don't seem to me as though that's hardly right,"
said the man with the catarrh in an aggrieved tone.

For a moment the New Yorker was speechless. Then
the veins stood out alongside the bunch on his neck and
he cried, "Oh, you whelp. If you wasn't right here in
the city, I'd smash you fine."

"We expected you would refund the money," said the
catarrhal sufferer.

"Now, that would be unreasonable," returned Panicky,
** unless there was such an understanding. I said I would
take them back, and that's what I've done. I wouldn't
wonder if you'd better keep your medicine. It may save
your lives," he added, placing the bottles on the side-
walk and leaving his dissatisfied customers.

There was a clink of broken glass. The New Yorker
had dyed the paving-stones with Great American
Panacea.

"What a waste," remarked Panicky to John. "That
might have preserved a human life that just as like as
not will be lost now. How lame that horse is. I wonder
what is the matter with him ? "

Panicky joined John immediately after his repulse by
the teamster. His strides were so rapid that his crippled
companion was soon left in the rear. "Can't you let out
a notch or two ?" he said. "We ought to be getting
around."

"We could get along faster if we took a more even
pace," returned John. "We walk five minutes and stop
fifty."

"That can't be helped," said Panicky. ** I have got my
work to do for the good of my race, and it must be done.
Sun, calm, wind, rain, snow or hail, I must travel and give
help to the afflicted. When we stop I'll let you have a
bottle of the panacea for your foot. I don't like to see a
man limp that way."

"Where are you going to take me ?" asked John.



286 THE CHRONICLES OE BREAK O* DA Y.

From this place to the journey's end John hardly looked
out of his car window.

"Come on, young man," said Panicky, as they stopped
at Lansing.

The surroundings of the depot were far from pleasing.
Before it was a willow swamp, which long lumber piles
and a manufactory made of brick, which a high, smoke-
blackened chimney, did not hide. The richest part of the
city, whose roofs and steeples alone were visible, lay to
the westward.

Small groups of citizens stood in front of the
passengerhouse. A pair of trucks with "Phoenix Mills" labeled
on the box was passing alongside the railroad track through
a cut. From a car on a side-track a good-natured looking
man was loading stove-wood into a wagon with a high box,
on which was inscribed the name of the commodity which
it was designed to carry. A wheeze from the old horse
by which the wagon was drawn instantly brought Panicky
to the spot.

"How do you do," said the peddler. "Bad cough that
horse has."

"Yes," answered the teamster, without stopping his
work an instant. "He's got the heaves."

"I know what will fix that in a hurry," said Panicky.
"Cobb's Concentrated Carbolic Cough Killer will kill any
cough that a horse ever had."

"I don't hardly think I'll buy to-day," said the teamster,
as if he disliked to wound the feelings of the patent
medicine man.

"If you use it once, you'll never be without it," said the
peddler. "Coughs, wheezing, running at the nose, colds,
animal influenza, distemper, heaves, none of them can
stand before the cough killer."

"It seems to me my brother got some of that for his
boss," said the teamster, still throwing the wood into the
wagon.

** Then you've found out it's a grand thing," said Panicky.
"Didn't it kill the cough ? "

"Well, no, not exactly," returned the teamster, straight-
ening up. "Killed the boss, though."

"Very lamentable, very," remarked Panicky, as he



THE CffRONfCLES OF BREAK C DA Y. 287

grabbed his satchels and started southward along the rail-
road track, followed by John. He had gone but a few rods
when he riveted his gaze on a robust appearing fellow who
was going toward the main part of the city.

"Must we stop again ?" asked John. "Take me to my
destination and then sell as much medicine as you like.''

"Young man," replied the peddler severely, "you are
too narrow-minded. You think the world was made for
you and your petty concerns. You must broaden out and
get sympathy for humanity."

The track ran through a piece of high ground which
descended to the west. The hillside at the east, covered
with scraggy brush, stood out in bold relief ; but the view
at the right was limited, because of its swift descent to the
hidden river and the low elevation of Che track. Scattered
along on the small rises of ground which overlooked the
stream, were diminutive cottages, of which a few were
painted. Before one of these little buildings a smooth-
faced old man wearing a Scotch cap was bent low, cut-
ting stove-wood with a dull buck-saw.

"That's hard business," remarked Panicky.

"There ain't nothin' easy about it," said the wood-saw-
yer, suspending his work.

"Don't you sometimes get tired ? "

"Yes, real. Sometimes I'm purty near played. I used
to be so I could stand it tol'able well, but late years 1
ain't so full o' besum."

"I noticed that before I got anywhere near you."

"You talk as if you knowed !" exclaimed the old man
in astonishment.

"I do. You can't fool me much about a man. Don't
your back ache some ? "

"Yes, yes," said the wood-sawyer, his wonder increas-
ing.

"And when you stoop over, it's a good deal worse ;
and if you stoop over long, you can't stand it and have to
straighten up, and then it'll get better for a while. But in
the morning, the day after you've worked hard, it's worse
than it is any other time."



288 THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK O' DA V.

"No," answered the peddler," I know more about it
than a doctor.''

** Do you think it's anything particular ? "

"Yes, it's deficient vigor in the back. Muscles lax,
spinal column imperfectly sustained.' It will keep getting
worse and worse until it finally downs you."

"Danged if I ain't a gittin' worried," said the old man,
letting go of his buck-saw. "Don't you s'pose I'll ever
i cure it ? "

I "It ain't at all likely," returned Panicky. "You'll probably
be a cripple and linger along for some years. But
you mustn't be discouraged. You ought to be ready to
die when your time comes."

"I know I orto be ready. But the lingerin*, I don't
like that 'ere. What 'ud you do for this back bizness if
, it was on you ? "

??? "I should cure it, if it was on me."

"I thought you said there wa'n't no cure for it."

"Oh, no, I thought you'd be apt to let it run until
there wasn't any hope for you."

"What 'ud you take for it, anyhow ? "

"I should take Great American Panacea and cure it in
three weeks."

"Where could a feller git a bottle o' that 'ere stuif ? "

"I've got a bottle I'll sell you for a dollar if you want
it."

** Oh, you're a sellin' of it," exclaimed the oid man, a
light suddenly breaking in on his dull understanding, '* I
don't believe I want none. Times is hard with me."

"You better take a bottle. Mister," urged Panicky.

and English, too."

"I don't want none on it," said the old man,

"Just as like as not, the trouble is in your kidneys," re-
naarked Panicky. " Your complexion looks like it. For
kidney disorders there never was anything could hold a
candle to Wakefield's Honey of Mullein and Sage."

"I ain't a-hankerin' to take no mullein nor sage," said
the old man. " My mother she give me sage tea when I
was a little chap, till I got clean degusted with it- I
smoked mullein, tryin' to give up tobaccer, an' I ain't
crazy for mullein no more. I won't buy no medicine to-
day."

"I know what will cure you," exclaimed the peddler.
"You need a bottle of Great Wangamyika Discovery."

"Now, I wouldn't wonder an there was smhin' in that,"
said the old man, impressed by the peculiar orthography
of the name.

"It's a great thing," said Panicky, " and no mistake.
There was an African chief, he was a great fellow to fight,
and he'd always fight with a club. Once, when he was
having a battle with another tribe, he got a lick in the
back that about used him up. He couldn't run and he
couldn't swing his war-club. That was what bothered
him the worst. Every morning he'd get up and see if he
couldn't fetch the war-club around, but it wasn't any use.
His enemies commenced to press him on every side, and
as he couldn't fight, of course his men got whipped.
This kept up quite a while, and at last he didn't have
much of any territory left. He said if he could onfy get
out himself and fight he could drive them back in short
order. He got all the big medicine men in his kingdom
to prescribe for him, but his back grew worse, instead of
better. By and by he lost his patience entirely, and he
said if they didn't relieve him inside of six months, off
would go their heads.

"That set 'em to thinking. They come together and
consulted. The first thing they done was to take some
slaves and lame 'em, as near as they could like the chief.
One of 'em practiced up till he could hit the right kind of
a wallop every time. The slaves they'd squirm around
'9

and yell, but nobody would pay any attention to 'em.

The medicine men Ihey fussed and fussed till they got
discouraged. They'd think a patient was on the gain,
when he'd up and die. They'd try five kinds of medicine,
and six, and eight, and twelve. They'd try half of one
kind and a twentieth of the rest, and a tenth of three or
four and different .parts of a lot of others.

"About two weeks before the timd was up, one of the
slaves got well. They fixed the chief up a few doses of
the same stufi, and he was swinging his war-club as well
as he ever did. He got so he could throw it in a curve
around one of his men and hit an enemy. His back
grew so stout that he didn't like a light club any more.
He had a heavy one mr.de' that nobody else could fetch
around in any kind of shape. There never was another
such a fellow to shake a war-club in Africa. A week after
he was cured he went out against the Maleovajaws, beat
'em and took their king prisoner. He let the medicine
men practice up on the prisoners, hitting 'em in the back
and curing 'em. He give 'em directions that they should
never let anybody know the secret of the medicine. One
of 'em did, though, told a missionary when he was dying.
The missionary thought folksin this country ought to have
it. He went all over Africa to gather the herbs, and sent
'em here. He named it Great Wangamyika discovery."

"This 'ere Great Wanagam cured the chief purty quick,
did it?" inquired the old man.

"Ves," answered Panicky, "very quick. There seems
to be something about it that's specially good for the back.
Affinity they call it for the spinal cord and the vertebrae,"

"I'll have a bottle if it busts me," said the old man.
"Hand it over."

Panicky instructed his customer how to use the medi-
cine. He must rub it in thoroughly, half of the time
stroking downward and half crosswise.

John and his companion soon came in sight of the
river ; and after crossing the railroad bridge, turned to the
right and followed the stream, leaving it, however, when
they had reached jhe next street which led to the left.

"How much farther have we to go ? " asked John.

"We're about there now," said Panicky, "that house
right ahead,"

It was a noble-looking structure which had been indi-
cated by the peddler. Whether the walls were of stone
or of brick, John, wiio knew little of architecture, could
not determine. An upright and a wing, on a rise of
ground too gradual and low to be called a hill, it was, sav-

"So I have," said Durgenson. " So I have. Til sat-
isfy you on that point to-night. I can't explain now. I'm

A woman rushed from the porch and interrupted John

went up a flight of stairs and into a small room as his
guide indicated.

The house was still, and the room, lighted only by one
window, was comparatively dark. As time passed curi-

John's dissatisfaction with his quarters increased. Mrs.
Boyle's neglected warning to avoid Durgenson, coupled
with the suspicious conduct of the woman who had con-

While he was deliberating whether to cry out and de-
mand release, or to attempt an escape from the window,
there came from below a voice, which, low but resonant,
filled him with a singular awe.
