        <p>
            This work was scanned and processed with optical character
            recognition (OCR) by Google. However, there was much to
            fix before it could be a proper e-book. For instance, stray
            characters, incorrect characters, hyphens to be removed, entire
            pages missing or gibberish. This repair work was completed and
            the book released through the Gutenberg Project by Nathan Hartley.
            Nathan performed this work in honor of his Great-Great-Great-Grandfather
            George Washington Holland Jr, from whom these stories are believed to
            have originated.>

            From "An Account of Ingham County From Its Organization"
            by Frank Turner, George Fuller and Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society.

            "G. W. Holland was historian and poet laureate of Bunkerhill and
            other townships where he resided for forty years. After 1876 he
            became the regular correspondent of the Ingham County Democrat
            and News, the Leslie Local, Stockbridge Sun and Lansing Sentinel.
            He was justice of the peace for twenty-two years, so could write
            from his court docket all kinds of stories. His pen name was
            "Rough and Ready," and he edited a set of stories about White
            Oak and Leroy townships, "Chronicles of Break o'Day." These
            were revised and made into a book by E. Everett Howe that had
            quite a sale. Four editions were published by Robert Smith
            Printing company."

        <p>
            This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library
            shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project to make
            the world's books discoverable online. It has survived long enough for the
            copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain
            book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term
            has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to
            country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a
            wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.
            Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will
            appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the publisher
            to a library and finally to you.

        <p class="center">USAGE GUIDELINES</p>

        <p>
            Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials
            and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the public and
            we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in
            order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to prevent abuse
            by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated
            querying. We also ask that you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use
                by individuals, and we request that you use these files for personal,
                non-commercial purposes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to
                Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine translation, optical
                character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is
                helpful, please contact us. We encourage the use of public domain materials for
                these purposes and may be able to help.
            </li>

            <li>
                Maintain attribution the Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential
                for in forming people about this project and helping them find additional
                materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it.
            </li>

            <li>
                Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for
                ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just because we
                believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the
                work is also in the public domain for users in other countries. Whether a book
                is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer
                guidance on whether any specific use of any specific book is allowed. Please do
                not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used
                in any manner anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liabilities can be
                quite severe.

        <p>
            My readers who are familiar with the traditions preserved
            in this history know one woman who is beloved by rich
            and poor, a comforter of the afflicted, a friend of the
            friendless, a mother of the motherless, in prosperity
            without arrogance, in sorrow without complaint. To
            Mrs. Fidelia Gibbins, whose character suggested the
            Mrs. Boyle of my story, this volume is respectfully
            dedicated.

            CHAPTER I.<br>
            <small>A RURAL PHILOSOPHER.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            For a territory containing no high mountain system,
            Michigan has a varied geography. In contrast to the
            sterile hills and grand, pictured rocks of the northern
            peninsula, the productive farms in the southern part of
            the state form an area of fertility unbroken save by a few
            patches of sand and some irregular strips of swamp. The
            largest and most remarkable of these swamps passes from
            north to south through Ingham and Jackson counties,
            extending beyond the borders of Shiawassee and Lenawee.
        </p>
        <p>
            This marshy territory is covered by a motley growth
            of willows, huckleberries, spruce, tamaracks and a few
            pines, in places so thin as to afford no inconvenience to a
            footman, in other places so thick as to be almost inaccessible.
            Horse-thieves, escaped convicts, and deserters from
            the army, have successively sought its seclusion; and
            never has the asylum betrayed the confidence of one who
            trusted in its hospitality.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the western side of the swampy belt lay a farm,
            which, according to the census of 1870, shared, with but
            four others in the State, the distinction of containing one
            thousand acres.
        </p>
        <p>
            The owner of this piece of property for many years was
            Major Ratke, an officer of the Mexican war. He was
            ambitious of acquiring distinction as a philosopher, both
            in his neighborhood and throughout the world. He was
            especially desirous of becoming famous ae a great inventor,
            and to this end he had constructed a large quantity
            of strange machinery. In his inventions he aimed at
            novelty, and so well did he succeed in this respect that
            even his bitterest enemies never accused him of a lack of
            originality.
        </p>
        <p>
            One March morning in 187--, the major was in the sitting-room
            of his gothic house working at an abstruse
            problem in mathematical philosophy, of which he was excessively
            fond. It was hard, however, for him to give it
            his undivided attention. Troubles had been gathering
            about his domain. A mortgage on his estate had been
            foreclosed, and his hired help, never famed for efficient
            service, now shirked duty with even more than their usual
            faithlessness. His widowed sister, Mrs. Grippin, a more
            acute and vigilant overseer than he, had from the chamber
            window repeatedly viewed through a telescope the
            delinquency of two men who were cutting wood on a back
            lot. Her vehement arraignment did not induce the major
            to take action upon the matter, till an event occurred
            which he considered an insult to his dignity as a master.
            He had sent them to the woods with an ax and an
            invention of his own, which he termed a "one-man saw,"
            but which his men called, from the labor of running it, the
            "six-man saw."
        </p>
        <p>
            Next to the "one-man saw" the ax was the tool most
            shunned about the farm. Accordingly, as soon as they
            thought themselves out of sight, the indignant laborers
            took a half-day's vacation to get some tobacco at the village
            of Break o'Day, which circumstance procured their
            immediate discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major had thought it an easy thing to supply
            their places. His surmise, however, was incorrect. Of
            the first three visitors who called at his residence after he
            put up the sign, "Wanted, two hired men," one was a
            lightning-rod man, one was a book agent, and the other a
            tramp, who hired out before breakfast, and after the meal
            declared that it was cold weather to work and that he
            would come around to begin when it got warmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding the foreclosure of the mortgage the
            major was planning sundry improvements on his place. A
            hill and a quagmire opposite to the house were eyesores
            to his vanity, and he determined to transfer the superfluous
            gravel of the one to the boggy surface of the other.
            His first step was nicely to calculate the expense of the
            undertaking, the only prudence of which he was capable,
            for expense never stood in the way of his projects. When
            he had finished a survey of the hill, he applied his mathematics
            to ascertain its cubical contents, using a confusion
            of geometrical and surveying terms to which Mrs. Grippin,
            though protesting, was obliged to listen.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, as he proceeded in his work, he determined to
            originate a new method for ascertaining the dimensions of
            solid bodies; and his inventive instinct prevailed to such
            an extent that it became greater than his desire to improve
            his farm.
        </p>
        <p>
            He declared that he would invent a system of mathematics
            which should be the basis of calculation for succeeding
            ages. He formed a small earthen mound to
            represent as nearly as possible the shape of the hill. He
            determined to ascertain the weight of the hill by the rule,
            "Similar bodies are to each other as the cubes of their
            like dimensions."
        </p>
        <p>
            As he was giving the miniature mountain a final pat to
            impart additional depth to a depression on its side, his
            sister interrupted his study.
        </p>
        <p>
            "James, there's a man coming."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Strong hand, is he?" asked the major, drawing his
            finger carefully down the mound.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Go and look for yourself," retorted Mrs. Grippin
            tartly." I ain't going to wait on you and let you fool
            with that pile of dirt."
        </p>
        <p>
            "He is as faithful as the day is long," said the major,
            going to the window. "I can tell by his gait. See how
            steadily he walks. He would work at a good jog chopping
            and keep it up all day. He would cut, let me see,
            a quarter of a cord an hour. Eight hours a day. That
            would be two cords."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll bet he's the biggest shirk in four counties," commented
            Mrs. Grippin sarcastically. "Anybody can tell
            all about a man by taking him for just the opposite of
            what you say he is."
        </p>
        <p>
            Two nieces of Mrs. Grippin and the major now entered
            from the parlor. The one in advance, Nora Warfle, was
            fair and vivacious, with eyes over which solemnity rarely
            drew a curtain thick enough to hide the merriment
            slumbering within.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was ever on the alert for the ridiculous and the
            mirthful, and in her efforts at diversion she was not always
            scrupulous about wounding the feelings of others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her companion, Marion Ratke, who resided permanently
            at the farm, was a true representative of her father's
            family. Her height was medium, her form symmetrical,
            and her hair dark brown. She was somewhat handsome,
            though she was too intelligent to be really a beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here comes a peddler, Manie," whispered Miss
            Warfle excitedly. "Let's buy something of him and beat
            him down on everything he sells."
        </p>
        <p>
            The man had drawn an attention altogether out of proportion
            to the impressiveness of his personal appearance.
            A common observer would at once have decided that he
            had long followed the occupation of peddling. He was
            of ordinary size and wore ordinary clothes. Strapped
            together and hanging, one before his breast and one over
            his back, were two large satchels. They seemed to have
            crowded down his neck and pushed out his chin until his
            shoulders were rounded almost to deformity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first characteristic act which he performed after
            passing through the door was to anticipate the offer of a
            chair by placing himself in one by the fire, as if he had
            done the same thing in the same place a thousand times
            before.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I suppose you've heard the news?" he said, with the
            air of one who holds a secret and who feels his power.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have heard a great many items of news this winter,"
            answered the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, but the news -- the late news. You ain't heard
            about the horse-thieves?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Horse-thieves?" echoed Miss Warfle. "Are they
            around again? Uncle James, you want to lock your barn
            or they'll be stealing Taylor."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," continued the man, "they've been at it again.
            This time they called on, what's his name? -- this man that
            raises horses over here. Queer I can't think."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sparks," suggested the major. "Lyman Sparks has
            the best horses of any man in Jefferson township."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, that ain't his name," answered the man, "it's
            Holmes. That's it, Holmes."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh," said the major. "The best horse Holmes has
            will not bring more than $300. Sparks has one for which
            he has been offered $600 -- Madge T., a very good blooded
            animal. He thinks she can outstep my Taylor. He did
            pass me once, but he would not if Taylor had hung to the
            trot."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No wonder he breaks up," put in his sister, "the way
            you train him. Do you know how he does, Nora? He
            trains his team to run. He'll make them stand stock still
            still he yells 'Charge,' and if they don't jump the first
            thing, he thrashes them. Then the next day he'll take Taylor
            out to trot."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Mrs. Grippin!" said the major, his voice sounding an
            octave below his usual speaking key.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Maybe you can get this gentleman to work, Uncle
            James," said Miss Ratke, wishing to put an end to the
            unpleasant controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well now, like enough," answered the major. "Do
            you want a job?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I've got one now," said the man, drawing a bottle
            from one of his satchels.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm going to do humanity all the good I can, sir, all
            the good I can. I am agent for the Great American
            Panacea. This medicine is compounded of pine, hemlock,
            tamarack, cedar and spruce, besides sovereign roots and
            herbs known to the medical fraternity. It cures cuts,

        </p>
        <p>
            "What did you say your panicky is made of?" interrupted
            the fair-haired Miss Warfle.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Panacea, Miss, panacea," corrected the peddler. "It
            cures cuts, bruises, sprains, wounds, incisions and all
            injuries to the flesh. It is also a sovereign remedy for
            asthma, bronchitis, tonsilitis, laryngitis and all throat
            diseases, besides being an excellent tonic for consumption,
            dyspepsia ---"
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is your panicky worth a bottle ?" innocently
            asked Miss Warfle.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Panacea, Miss, panacea," again corrected the medicine
            man. "Panicky is in a battle where the men get in a
            tight place with the rebels coming right onto 'em so they
            have to run, you know. Then when they get whipped and
            can't fight any more, they have what they call a panic, you
            know, or, as you might say, they get panicky. But this is
            a different thing altogether. Better take a bottle. Mister.
            It is a sovereign remedy for asthma, bronchitis, tonsilitis,
            laryngitis "
        </p>
        <p>
            "I would like a good liniment for bruises," said the
            major, "but it is impossible for one remedy to cure so
            many diseases. If it is prepared for everything, it is
            pretty sure to cure nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I ain't so sure about the consumption and the throat
            diseases," said the agent reflectively. "I thought it
            would be good for them on account of its healing proper-
            ties, but it's sure business for bruises."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Have you a good salve?" asked the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's just what I've got," responded the man with
            alacrity, "Derrick's Dough of Life." There's Bill Higgins
            had a colt that got his leg cut on a scythe. Laid it right
            open so the hide was left in flaps. Bill says to me, 'Say,
            Dabney, what'll cure that cut?' and says I, 'I've got the
            very thing for that.' Well, he put on the Dough of Life.
            In two weeks the colt was capering round to beat all. He
            got into the corn, knocked over a fence, chased the cattle
            and sheep, and killed two lambs and kicked the hired man
            on the leg. And I don't know what the hired man would
            have done if it hadn't been for the panacea."
        </p>
        <p>
            When the agent had sold a box of the salve he moved
            toward the back-door and said, "I guess I'll go down
            and try your men. Maybe some of them'll want to buy."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You better wait till noon," said Mrs. Grippin. "Then
            the men won't have to stop work."
        </p>
        <p>
            "They never mind that," said the agent." They was
            always real good about stopping whenever I come around."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Of course they'd be willing to stop and gab with him,"
            commented Mrs. Grippin, looking after the retreating
            agent." James Ratke, if you had the gumption of a man,
            you'd kick such loafers off the farm when they come
            palavering round with an excuse for your lazy hired
            men to stop work."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How did he know I had so many hired men?" asked
            the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "How did he know?" repeated his sister. "Ain't he
            been here half a dozen times before? He comes about
            every six months, and a nuisance he is, too. Ain't you
            heard them tell about old Panicky? You're the only man
            in the country that don't know him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, yes," said the major, "I do have some recollection
            of him; but I was away from home when he made his
            last two or three visits."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In the name of mercy," exclaimed Mrs. Grippin, "if
            there ain't another lightning-rod man."
        </p>
        <p>
            The young man coming up the walk might have been
            twenty-eight. The preceding speculation concerning his
            profession seemed correct, for nothing about him indicated
            acquaintance with farm labor. His elegant form, his
            dark hair and eyes and a heavy brown mustache combined
            with an air of easy grace to make him one of those
            so rarely met with whom any apparel becomes. Yet, as
            is usually the case with such individuals, he bestowed
            more care on his personal appearance than he would
            have bestowed had nature made such attention more
            necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stranger with few preliminaries made an application
            for work. To this proposal Ratke did not immediately
            reply. He gave his own name and requested the young
            man to do likewise.
        </p>
        <p>
            "My name is Montcalm," said the stranger, with a
            smile which at once won the major's heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Montcalm," exclaimed the major; "that is the name
            of one of my comrades in the army."
        </p>
        <p>
            "My father held the rank of captain in the Mexican
            war," said Montcalm. "I am the heir to his given name,
            which was Traceworth."
        </p>
        <p>
            Instantly the major was shaking him by the hand." Is
            he alive? Is he well? Where does he live?" were his
            ejaculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He died fifteen years ago," answered Montcalm, "at
            his home in Cortland, New York."
        </p>
        <p>
            "He was a noble fellow," said the major, "and his
            sword was one of the best in the brigade. General Taylor,
            in his official report, made special mention of him for
            bravery in the battle of Resaca de la Palma. I was by
            his side during the engagement, and I, like the rest of the
            men, noticed his impetuosity, though I had little time to
            watch my comrades. It always seemed as if he ought to
            have been promoted, but justice is not in every case meted
            out in this world. Did you ever hear him speak of me?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have heard him mention his comrades in the army,
            but I have forgotten their names," answered Montcalm.
            "I was young when he died."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We first got acquainted in the Black-Hawk war," said
            the old man." He was generally good-natured, but he
            had a terrible temper and was very set in his way. I
            have suspected that that was one thing which kept him
            from rising in the service. One night on Wisconsin River,
            after we had been chasing Black-Hawk all day, the
            mosquitos were very thick. Some of the boys rolled and
            tumbled and some swore. As I was exposing first one
            part of my face and then another, to see if there was not
            some place the pests had less relish for, I heard a
            threshing so regular that I knew whoever was making it meant
            to push hostilities to the last, and when I looked, I saw
            Trace sitting up and striking as deliberately as he would
            plan a compaign. But it was a wicked vindictiveness,
            and when the lieutenant laughed at him, he wanted to
            fight.
        </p>
        <p>
            "His set ways came near getting him into trouble once.
            It was at the last battle in the Wisconsin territory. The
            Indians had been beaten and were swimming across a
            slough, bucks, pappooses and squaws all splashing around
            together. We had orders to fire on them from the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Trace told me he thought it was a hard sight, and he
            would fire, but he would take care the bullets did not hit
            anybody. Most of the Indians were shot down before
            they got across. One old buck turned back to help a
            squaw, probably his own, to get her pappoose to shore.
            Trace and I wanted to have that old fellow get clear; but I
            while we were congratulating ourselves that he stood a
            little chance, Ben Rogers, right close by, drew a careful
            bead on him. Now, Ben was the best shot in the regiment,
            and my heart went down in my boot-heels, but
            Trace jostled him just as he fired. Well, Ben was mad.
            He threatened to report, and if he had. Trace might have
            got court-martialed, but he never did. Trace's jostling
            did no good, however. The old buck fell, going over
            the bluff on the other side. How long before dinner,
            Maria?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "About three-quarters of an hour," answered Mrs.
            Grippin with unaccustomed good-nature. "I'll ring the
            bell when it's time, and I ought to have a load of wood,
            James."
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," responded the major. "Show Trace his
            room. I must call you Trace on your father's account,
            for it is a luxury to address his son as I did him. We
            will make no bargain till after dinner."
        </p>
        <p>
            After bringing in the wood, Ratke waited a few minutes
            for Montcalm's appearance. At the end of that period
            Montcalm came from the bedroom, wearing a suit of plain
            clothes and a pair of stoga boots. Even this dress did
            not give him the air of a farmer, which he had evidently
            sought to assume. His hands, soft and white, indicated
            that he was unacquainted with muscular toil; and his
            whole aspect and demeanor, in ways not easily described,
            pointed to the same conclusion. There was in his address
            something which was peculiarly winning, and which would
            have fascinated Ratke without the assistance of the
            veteran's friendship for his old comrade.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why, you have made a farmer of yourself," said the
            major. "No, you have only tried to. Well, suppose we
            look around a little before dinner. Go to work now? No,
            sir, not a stroke do you do till one o'clock;" and, leading
            the way, the master of the domain passed out to a survey
            of the farm; but Mrs. Grippin called him back to take
            from her table the pile of dirt intended as the basis of his
            mathematical calculations.

            CHAPTER II.<br>
            <small>THE NEW JERUSALEM.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Montcalm observed that part of the estate which was
            open to his view. The white wrap of winter was nearly
            worn out, but here and there islands and peninsulas of
            snow glimmered in isolated stations from the somberer
            areas of lately uncovered earth, or stretched away in
            varying and grotesquely formed curves to join the more
            protected strips along the fences. The cultivated land on
            that side of the road was enclosed in semicircular shape,
            and a strip of timber extended from the swamp to a point
            northwest of the house, as if starting out to cut the
            improvements in twain, and afterward repenting of its
            design. At the western end it terminated in a patch of
            shrubs over which could be seen the tops of the statelier
            trees beyond. To the east the hardwood timber, mostly
            of oak, skirted, till it nearly reached the road, along the
            marsh which bordered the great swamp. The only signs
            of vegetable life which were visible to Montcalm were in
            the spruce and pine, which could be distinguished from
            the tamaracks by their evergreen branches.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the major discoursing volubly as they went along,
            the two men passed to the barns. These were three in
            number. The largest, ornamented on the top with three
            cupolas and a prancing horse, was the center from the
            extremities of which branched the others, nearly forming
            a yard, which was completed by a connecting fence.
        </p>
        <p>
            A discourse, which his biographer has not taken the
            trouble to find, was given by the major on the character
            and phrenology of each beast: on the horse which would
            threaten but never kick, on the one which would kick but
            never threaten, on the cow which would jump from good
            to poor pasture for the mere satisfaction of being unruly,
            and on several others which would jump from poor to
            good pasture for obvious reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here is the finest animal I have," said the major, laying
            his hand on the hip of a horse with a long foretop and
            a fine head and ears. "Zachary Taylor, probably the
            best blooded horse in the county. Taylor went in two
            fifty-nine when he was four, just previous to his purchase
            by me. He ought to beat that by twenty seconds now,
            but I have let Maria and Manie drive him. Next summer
            nobody except myself shall hold a rein over him. Taylor,
            old boy, you want an ear of corn? You have not seen my
            machine shop," said the animated old man, opening the
            door of a building at the west end of the group of barns.
            "Are you interested in machinery?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have an interest in progress," answered Montcalm,
            "but little knowledge of mechanics."
        </p>
        <p>
            A practical machinist would have had much difficulty
            in classifying the various specimens of constructive talent
            hanging on the walls and strewn in chaos about the floor.
            Old reapers, clocks, fanning mills and threshing machines
            had been dissected to furnish material for wild inventive
            schemes, more than half of which had been left unfinished.
            A strange looking wagon had in an unusual degree the
            merit of originality. Each wheel, six feet high, revolved
            on a peg set between two upright posts. These posts
            were connected at the top so that the vehicle had no axle-
            tree. Two boxes suspended from the posts, and about
            two and one half feet in height, were joined together by
            an attachment underneath.
        </p>
        <p>
            "A revolution in road vehicles is coming," began the
            major." The days of hard pulling and breaking horses'
            legs by blows from the tongue are almost over. You can
            see at once that this wagon must have a light draught.
            The attachment of the tongue down low lessens the rolling
            friction on the ground, and the six-foot wheel does a
            great deal to lessen the sliding friction on the axle. Let
            me make that plain. The passage of the wheel along the
            ground is called friction, but I question its right to the
            definition. One molecule is planted on the ground and
            rests there until another takes its place, when it rises and
            a second particle becomes the pivotal point, to be succeeded
            by the third, fourth and so on. The only friction
            then is in the adhesion of the surfaces as the upper one
            is planted down and removed; a great difference, you
            observe, from that which comes from passing parallel with
            the surface of a body. But that at the point of the
            revolutionary pivot is different. Here the wheel is continually
            scraping over the axle, a resistance which it requires
            much more force to overcome. A six-foot wheel revolves
            every -- let me see -- every six multiplied by three and one
            thousand and four hundred and sixteen ten-thousandths,"
            and the major began to figure on the wall, "every time it
            goes eighteen and eight thousand four hundred and
            ninety-six ten-thousandth's feet. A four-and-one-half-foot
            wheel revolves, I'll tell you in a moment -- every time it
            goes fourteen and one thousand three hundred and
            seventy-two ten-thousandth's feet. The smaller wheels,
            having a swifter movement at the pivot, occasion a greater
            amount of friction."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, though tortured by the tedious harangue,
            practiced his well learned art of flattery by attention, and
            tipped his head on one side with an air of gravest concern.
        </p>
        <p>
            "If I had it in shape," pursued the major, "we would
            hitch on and try it, but it is not ironed yet, and it has cost
            me too much labor to use it up recklessly."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm hastened to protest against the sacrifice to
            his curiosity of an invention which had cost so much labor
            of hand and brain. He was anxious, very anxious, to see
            the wagon tested, but he begged the major on no account
            to subject it to a trial until it was properly ironed and
            fitted for running.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll tell you what we can do," suggested the major.
            "Get in and let me draw you, and we will try its draught."
        </p>
        <p>
            To this proposal Montcalm objected, but he volunteered
            to act as horse while the major rode. Accordingly the inventor
            seated himself in the product of his genius, which
            Montcalm drew back and forth, praising the lightness of
            its draught and suppressing the grunts whose utterance
            would have belied his statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Montcalm's energy began to flag, the major inquired,
            "You do not know the name of the wagon, do you, Trace?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I was wondering about that," answered Montcalm;
            "it seems to me an ancient name would be proper, some
            kind of chariot, -- Pharaoh's chariot for instance."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," said the major, shaking his head and clambering
            from the vehicle," I call it the New Jerusalem."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What induced you to call it that?" asked Montcalm.
            "Was it the splendor of the ornaments you mean to put
            on or some reason which I do not comprehend?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well," answered the major, purposely keeping his
            auditor in suspense," it is a long history. Some years
            ago there was, over across the swamp, an old man by the
            name of Barrow, an out-and-out Adventist. He said the
            world was coming to an end before long. He could not
            tell exactly when, but it could not be longer than '69, and
            he could prove it by the prophecies in fourteen different
            ways. He used to go up and down the road to Break o'Day,
            and to the neighbors' houses, without a hat, always
            with the same strain, 'Babylon is fallen, is fallen.' A
            quarter of the topers and loafers who hung around Rorus's
            drug-store were scared into leaving off an occasional spree,
            and the other three-quarters had some fun repeating his
            prophecies about the restoration of the Jews. One day
            he came bareheaded out to the barn, where my men and I
            were looking over the old wagon, the first one I invented,
            and he began:
        </p>
        <p>
            "'The world's going to burn -- going to burn up, I tell
            you. The time of the Gentiles is fulfilled. Babylon the
            great is fallen, is fallen' (the old man always talked fast),
            'and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of
            every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful
            bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath
            of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
            fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth
            are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
            Come out of her, my people. The Jews are to be gathered
            to Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
            "'When will the great day come? "For the day of vengeance
            is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come.
        </p>
        <p>
            "'"From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
            away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up,
            there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days."
        </p>
        <p>
            '"'That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust
            eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm
            eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the
            caterpillar eaten.'
        </p>
        <p>
            '"'We've had the caterpillar and the grasshopper and the
            potato-bug and the weevil. Describes it exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
            '"'And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay
            desolate in the sight of all that passed by.'
        </p>
        <p>
            "'Jerusalem has been so they couldn't raise a thing there,
            not a thing, and now they're raising wheat. Wheat in
            Jerusalem! They sent a thrashing machine there last year.
        </p>
        <p>
            "'We've got to turn in with the Jews and go to Jerusalem.
            Never mind your wagon, Ratke. You better make a Jerusalem
            wagon.'
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, the idea struck my men so forcibly that they
            dubbed it the Jerusalem wagon, and the name always stuck
            by it. I like it well enough myself, and so after I made
            the second one, to distinguish between them, I called it
            the New Jerusalem."
        </p>
        <p>
            It is as yet an unsolved problem how long the old man
            would have continued the recital of these reminiscences
            had he not been interrupted by a strange clamor from near
            the house. The noise seemed to be produced by the
            strokes of some metallic object against a steel plate, which
            had a resonance sufficient to make the sound continuous.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Dinner!" exclaimed the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the men left the machine shop, the cause of the commotion
            was apparent to Montcalm. Mrs. Grippin, with
            the energy characteristic of all her actions, was using a
            two-foot iron bar to belabor a long upright saw suspended
            from an apple-tree, and that superannuated piece of
            machinery was protesting against the punishment with
            the most doleful lamentations.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You have not expressed your opinion of my bell.
            Trace," said the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It has a very powerful voice," commented Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Make an estimate of the cost of that bell," said the
            major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ten dollars," suggested Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Twenty-five dollars."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I give it up," said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I calculate that that bell cost me about ten thousand
            dollars," said the major, watching his companion to note
            the effect of his words.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Indeed!" exclaimed Montcalm, manifesting the proper
            amount of surprise. "How is that?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is the old upright saw which used to be in McGraw's
            mill," said the major. "I got it for one dollar,
            and, in less than a month, I had the plan for a drag-saw
            for small logs that was ahead of any invention which had
            been projected up to that date, for it was to take only two
            horses. One day, about noon, I heard a hubbub loud
            enough to wake the nations, and when I got where it was,
            I found Maria pounding the edge of that saw just as she
            is doing now. See how viciously she strikes, as if she
            were bent on destroying the last vestige of its usefulness.
            She had banged the teeth so much that using it afterwards
            was wholly put of the question. I always suspected that
            she did it on purpose to defeat my plan. And she did.
            I turned my attention to the old Jerusalem, and before I
            did anything more with the saw, a Wisconsin lumberman
            had the start of me. If all people were like her, this
            would be an unprogressive world."
        </p>
        <p>
            On entering the house, the veteran found awaiting him
            a visitor, whom Mrs. Grippin introduced as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            "James, here is a man that wants work."
        </p>
        <p>
            The major made mental observations on the capacity
            of the new-comer for labor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The young fellow, who was not more than twenty-two
            years old, gave his name as John Wrengell. His stature
            was above the common height, but his form was not Stocky.
            He had Saxon blue eyes, light brown hair and the sensitive
            nature which accompanies the nervous temperament.
            The evidence of a strong character was visible in his
            well-shaped head, his expressive countenance and his
            intelligent, though embarrassed speech.
        </p>
        <p>
            The introduction to the ladies exhibited a vast difference
            between Montcalm and Wrengell. Montcalm bowed
            with a courtesy which was at once easy and pleasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrengell blushed, mispronounced one name, half mumbled
            the other, and in sitting down overturned with a
            backward sweep of his arm the heap of dirt so much
            doted on by the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            Miss Warfle with much difficulty repressed her mirth,
            and the old officer with still more trouble kept back his
            irritation from open expression.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There, James," exclaimed Mrs. Grippin, who arrived
            on the scene just in time to see the sand and gravel
            scattered over the floor." There, I told you you'd have
            that thing tipped over. Can't you bring in dirt enough
            on your boots without lugging it in in a heap to make me
            sweep up?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I thought," responded the major, "that my model
            hill would keep its line of direction within its base, and that
            its cohesion would not be acted upon by external forces
            sufficiently to destroy it. My clay mound stayed here
            two weeks, and it constantly maintained a preponderance
            of attractive over repulsive forces, but clay possesses
            more viscosity than sand."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Viscosity," repeated Mrs. Grippin in disgust. "Now
            you've got on one of your high-sounding strains. Can't
            you talk so anybody can understand you? Who ever
            heard of viscosity?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is a mortifying fact," said the major, putting a degree
            of solemnity into his voice," that I have a sister who
            does not know the meaning of viscosity. It is derived
            from the Latin viscum. Viscum, viscositas; French, viscosite;
            Provencal, viscositat; Spanish, viscosidad; Portuguese, vis---"
        </p>
        <p>
            "'What do we care about your viscos and viscovuses?"
            retorted Mrs. Grippin. "When you talk common English,
            folks give you credit for some sense, but when you
            try to show off so smart, everybody is disgusted with you."
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach of the hired men was now heralded by
            the confused hum of voices, varied now and then by a
            boisterous laugh. When they had taken their turns at
            the wash-dishes, the towel and the looking-glass, they
            passed to the dining-room.

        <h2><a id="Page_17"></a>
            CHAPTER III.<br>
            <small>A GLIMPSE OF FARM SERVICE.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            The farmhouse had been built in the days of Ratke's
            prosperity. It was gothic in design and had three principal
            rooms -- the sitting-room, the dining-room and the
            parlor.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the northern side, and extending to the kitchen at
            the eastern extremity of the dwelling, was a tier of
            bedrooms and closets. Not satisfied with the half-dozen
            sleeping apartments in the row alluded to and several
            more in the chamber, the major had provided for the
            construction, on the side facing the street, of two more
            bedrooms which, jutting inwardly, formed a narrow hall
            between the sitting-room and the parlor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main divisions of the house were inappropriately
            named, or, at least, not named according to the uses to
            which they were put. The dining-room served much as
            a sitting-room, the sitting-room on account of its superior
            warmth was used in cold weather as a dining-room, and
            the parlor, which contained the organ and the library in
            four bookcases, was almost daily used by the family. It
            is true that this subversion of common usage was much
            censured by Mrs. Grippin, but there were, as we have
            seen, on this estate and in this household, certain evils
            which even she was powerless to remedy.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were seated around the extension table thirteen
            persons, the resident family of four, six hired men, two
            prospective ones, and the agent, who was called Panicky,
            and whom the major had easily persuaded to stay to
            dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Major," said a fellow whose name was Brown, "how
            is it when you're shooting birds on the wing? Do you
            want to aim straight at 'em or a little ahead?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "A little ahead, to be sure," replied Ratke, and, laying
            down his knife and fork, he gave a discourse of five
            minutes on the principles of absolute and relative motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There, Wingscheut," exclaimed Brown," the reason
            you didn't hit the quail was because you aimed straight
            at her."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Tat ain't te reason at all," answered a tall German
            with dark hair and a fringe of whiskers running underneath
            his chin." I aim't chust as you tolt me an' tat's
            te reason I titn't hit 'im."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Will," asked the major, "did you take good care of
            Taylor?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I fed him and curried him off," replied Archer, the
            man whom Ratke addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," said the German, in the loud tone he had previously
            used, "unt, if it hatn't a peen for me, you
            vootn't a hat no Taylor."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How is that, Wingscheut?" queried the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Vell, you see," began Wingscheut, "las' night I vass
            sleepin' in te clup-house. Unt, chust apout tvelf o'clock,
            I heert te parn toor co skveak. Vell, I know provitin' te

            Taylor. Unt tey vass pic fellers, piccern ole Chon
            Tafis.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Vell, ten I come out from te tool-house. Unt I
            catched poth of 'em hiplock, von on von hip unt von on
            te otter. Unt I trowet 'em. Unt I pountet 'em till tey
            hat te sorest faces. Provitin' you hatn't a peen asleep so
            sount as you couldn't vake, you voot a heert 'em yell."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why didn't you hold 'em when you had 'em?" asked
            Jake Sheppard, the oldest and most trusty of the hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Vell, you see," answered Wingscheut, "Taylor he gits
            avay. Unt he runs up te roat. Unt I titn't vant to lose
            a horse vat vass vorth a tousan' tollars for two tam
            horsetiefs vat vass goot for notting at all. So I coes on
            after Taylor. Provitin' you ton't pelieve me, I can show you
            vere tey lay."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wingscheut give 'em sore faces, for I saw him," whispered
            a solemn-looking young man from the lower end of the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every one present listened to this confirmation of
            Wingscheut's doubtful veracity.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Vell, you see," continued Daggett, the voiceless young
            man, mocking the German's peculiar accent, "Vingscheut
            unt me, ve kilt te tam horse-tiefs, unt ve took teir scalps.
            Unt four more tam horse-tiefs, tey come up to git Taylor.
            Unt Vingscheut catched two of 'em hiplock. Unt I
            catched two of 'em hiplock. Unt ve kilt 'em. Unt ve

            ve took teir scalps. Unt, provitin' you ton't pelieve it,
            ve can show you te scalps."
        </p>
        <p>
            When Wingscheut had mastered his disgust and an immense
            mouthful of beefsteak, he said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Provitin' I vass such a liar as tat, I voot crawl off in
            a holler loc unt tie."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How do you get along with the one-man saw, Jake?"
            queried the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Back aches like time," answered Sheppard, drawing
            his hand along his spine.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is strange," observed Ratke. "The one-man
            saw is certainly a great saving of labor. It allows you,
            instead of stooping over, or dropping your hands by your
            side, to push toward the log straight from the shoulder.
            The motory power is in the muscles of the shoulder and
            upper arm; and this power, the hand and the saw, should
            be as nearly as possible in a straight line. The common
            cross-cut, as it is worked, with the hands on a level with
            the hips, is a lever of the third class, power in the center,
            fulcrum at one end and weight at the other. In this lever
            there is a gain of motion and a corresponding loss of
            power. But, as to the loss of motion in the one-man saw,
            that can be easily made up by a swaying movement of the
            body."
        </p>
        <p>
            At the conclusion of the meal Wrengell and Montcalm
            hired out for the summer, Wrengell getting twenty dollars
            per month, and Montcalm, out of consideration for Ratke's
            friendship for his father, receiving twenty-five dollars.
            Montcalm stayed in the house, conversing with the major,
            while the rest of the hired men, together with the vender
            of medicine, or Panicky, went to the club-house.
        </p>
        <p>
            This building was a two-story upright, whose dimensions
            were thirty-two by thirty-six feet. On the ground
            floor were three bedrooms and one larger apartment,
            which contained a clock with an alarm, a table, a stove,
            common chairs, rocking-chairs and all the furniture
            necessary for the comfortable accommodation of a family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Panicky surmised that Archer was bilious, that Sheppard
            had lumbago, and assured Daggett that all he needed
            for the complete restoration of his voice was a bottle of
            Great American Panacea. By a series of harangues on
            individual complaints, followed by an eloquent exordium,
            he sold a bottle of the panacea to the hands, of whom all,
            except Wingscheut, contributed equally to the purchase-money.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, boys," said Jake Sheppard, "'m a-goin' to
            work."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh! there ain't no hurry," declared Archer; "the
            major he wouldn't say anything if we didn't go for an
            hour yet."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Maybe he wouldn't say nothin'," replied Jake, "but
            right's right, an' loafin' roun' when you're paid to work
            ain't right."
        </p>
        <p>
            The major sat watching the departure of his nieces,
            who were about to drive his trotter, Taylor, to Break O'Day;
            The girls were passing a small house not far from the swamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            The preceding spring Philetus Takum had come to
            Ratke with a piteous appeal for help. He had been
            turned out of doors by his landlord, and left without
            shelter for himself and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major, against the remonstrances of his household
            erected a tenement house near the swamp and put it into
            the possession of Takum. But . Philetus proved a disappointment
            to his benefactor. Not only did he neglect
            to pay the promised rent, but he circulated some annoying
            untruths and many more annoying truths concerning
            Ratke and his mortgaged estate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most valuable of Takum's personal property was a
            mongrel shepherd dog which bore the name of Lina.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next in value were two of her full-grown progeny, which
            Philetus kept, for he had made many a solemn declaration
            that he would not sell a pup for less than one dollar, and
            he had been offered for the largest one only eighty-five
            cents. Mrs. Grippin declared that the dogs ate eggs, and
            that their master had an equal fondness for stolen
            chickens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ratke was sitting, as was his wont in meditation, with
            his left leg thrown over the arm of his rocking-chair, his
            elbow on his knee and his head resting on his hand. Left
            to himself, he plunged deeply into his philosophical
            studies. His mind was clear, his absorption complete.
            The principles of nature's mighty phenomena, enlarging
            in scope and simplifying in form, passed one by one before
            his vision with clearness and majesty; and, as he
            thought, more than ever showed the harmony of natural
            and mental philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            He became conscious that something was drawing him
            away from his delightful reverie. Some external circumstance
            was tugging at his attention, which still clung
            tenaciously to the theories which he was formulating.
            Reluctantly he dropped his hand and threw his left leg
            from the arm of the rocking-chair, when he heard the
            voice of Mrs. Grippin calling from the chamber,
        </p>
        <p>
            "James, James."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," returned the major, throwing his leg back to its
            favorite position.
        </p>
        <p>
            "James, James," cried Mrs. Grippin, more loudly than
            before.
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," responded Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But it isn't all right," said the housekeeper. "Come
            up here, and you'll see that it's all wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I suppose I must go," thought the major. "Maria is
            a continuous force, which, though exercising a slight
            amount of influence per unit of time, in the lapse of concrete
            time brings to bear a stress, the total amount of
            which is enormous."
        </p>
        <p>
            When he entered the chamber, Mrs. Grippin was standing
            on a box by a north window, from which she was
            endeavoring to obtain a view of the woods where the men
            were at work.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can't see many of them," she said. "There is the
            new man you like so well with the one-man saw. See
            how he has to pull! It looks as though it would break
            his back. He's got that swaying motion of the body you
            tell so much about. I guess nobody would pull that thing
            through a log without swaying the body."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If that is all you want of me," remarked the major,
            "I will go down."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think some of the men are shirking," said Mrs.
            Grippin. "The woods are in the way so I can't see them.
            You'd better go down where they are."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I do not like to appear suspicious of them," the major
            remonstrated. "Does it not please you to know that
            others have confidence in you?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, confidence in everybody," answered Mrs. Grippin;
            "that's the trouble with you. Men consult their own
            interest and they don't work hard for other folks unless
            they have to."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why," ejaculated Ratke, "you are advocating the
            principles of 'Elementa Philosophica de Cive.'"
        </p>
        <p>
            "What do I care what you call it?" returned Mrs.
            Grippin." I tell you, you can't trust folks in that way
            without watching them."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Bolder yet!" exclaimed the major. "Now you are
            branching off on the Leviathan. I never thought you
            would be a Hobbist, Maria."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do I have any more hobbies than you do," furiously
            retorted the housekeeper; "you, with your nonsense that
            nobody else can stand? I'd talk about hobbies."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, no, Maria," mildly expostulated the major. "A
            Hobbist means---"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't care what it means," interrupted Mrs. Grippin.
            "James Ratke, if you don't go down there I won't get a
            morsel of dinner for your men. Now, you can understand.
            You can do just as you like."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can go for the sake of peace," said the major, with
            a sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he started from the house, he was looking over
            the tops of some tamaracks at the right of his destination,
            which he meant to reach by means of the path leading to
            the woods. Now it is unlikely that anything in the tamaracks
            interested him, if at that time he was conscious of
            their existence. Whatever the cause of his abstraction,
            it had the effect of taking him far out of his intended
            course. Nor was he aware of the deviation until he was
            confronted by the thick growth of bushes, which, to enter,
            he had to part with his hands. Suspending temporarily
            his meditations, he came upon a path which ran trans-
            versely through the shrubs, and which crossed at right
            angles the one which he had intended to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            He proceeded along this path and stopped near a
            broken tree whose upper portion, lying on the ground,
            was hidden from him by the standing stub. Glancing
            around and satisfying himself that he was not observed
            he said slowly and emphatically,
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition I.: The will of man has the power of
            independent decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition II. : All external forces acting upon the
            will are persuasive and not coercive." Here the major
            paused and spatted his hands with great emphasis.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition III. : Whenever in---"
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a rustling in the bushes followed by a succession
            of very rapid and heavy blows from an ax. Going
            around the stub, the major came upon Archer, who was
            working at a rate which, had it been maintained, would
            soon have cut down the patch of grubs so circumscribing
            to the observations of Mrs. Grippin. It is impossible to
            tell which one of the two was most embarrassed, the hired
            man who had been sleeping on the fallen tree or his employer
            who had been caught in what would generally be
            considered a very foolish soliloquy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each felt that he had drawn the unpleasant attention
            of his companion, and each consequently gave no heed
            to the weakness of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major was the first to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are knocking them down at a great rate. Will."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," answered Archer, springing toward a sapling,
            which he felled at a few tremendous strokes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I would not heat myself too much," protested the
            major. "There are other days coming."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Got to earn our money," returned Archer, rushing
            at another sapling.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It seems to me," remarked the major, "that one
            making such violent exertions as you are would be
            encumbered by two coats and a jacket."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ain't had time to take 'em off yet," explained Archer,
            as he threw aside his superfluous clothing. "Whew, but
            it's warm!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think I will go over where the boys are," observed
            the major. "I only hear one saw there."
        </p>
        <p>
            Archer, clearing his throat, struck up a fragment of a
            song, whose pitch to the end was not more than a note
            higher or lower than the one with which it commenced.
        </p>

            At the conclusion of the doggerel strain, the woods were
            ringing with life. A saw vibrated more energetically than
            the one which Ratke had first heard, and several axes
            were swung so rapidly as to produce almost a clatter.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Right at it," remarked the major, as he neared the
            spot where Brown and Daggett were sawing. "I see
            that there are a great many ergs of work in my men."
        </p>
        <p>
            Daggett's hard sawing, by which he had sought to lull
            the major's suspicion, resulted in a fit of violent coughing,
            and he was obliged to seat himself on a log and wait until
            the paroxysm had passed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is a bad cough, boy," said the major, "and you
            are making it worse by getting heated."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I'm all right," returned Daggett.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, you are in a bad condition," contradicted the
            major." I insist that you take a more moderate gait. I
            do not wish you to exhaust your energy before the
            commencement of the summer's work. I must go up where
            Trace is now."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hanged if I ain't ashamed," commented Daggett,
            when the major had gone out of hearing. "Here we've
            been playing off all we could, and the first thing we know
            he comes around and tells us to go slower. I half believe
            that, if I was well, I'd pitch in and work decent for the
            old fellow."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, no, you wouldn't," returned Brown. "You
            wouldn't like that any better than you do now. We
            didn't have much warning, did we? Will got asleep. He
            must of. An' it wasn't the square thing to do."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, it wasn't," affirmed Daggett, forgetting his
            resolution to be industrious. "We'll get even with him for
            that. Go up and tell him the captain demands his immediate
            presence."
        </p>
        <p>
            Archer, whose craving for sleep had been nearly satisfied
            by indulgence, was not loth to leave his position as
            sentinel. Such a summons was usually the forerunner of
            sport, and he believed, from the direct manner in which
            Daggett had sent for him, that, for the coming amusement,
            he was not to pay the reckoning.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the discontented looks of the men gave token that
            they were not in the best of humor, while by their frequent
            glances toward him he was warned that he was the
            object of their dissatisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, boys," he called out, "has the old man gone?
            I done my duty as a sentinel, didn't I ? I warned you."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, you did warn us," said Daggett in a whisper
            which was almost vocalization, "after the boss had got
            here. That was a great way to do."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I didn't see him," explained Archer, "until he got
            right onto me. And the first thing I knew I heard him
            getting off some of his philosophy trash."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You vass sleepin'," asserted Wingscheut. "Tat vass
            a mean trick. Provitin' I cootn't vake up a little vile, I
            voot co to pet."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Take him to the guard-house," ordered Daggett.
        </p>
        <p>
            Archer was seized, and, despite his struggles and
            threats, thrown to the ground, when the men began to
            cover him with brush. Whenever he attempted to rise,
            he was pushed back; and, as soon as he threw aside a
            bush, it was succeeded by another. So, realizing the
            uselessness of further resistance, he lay still and was
            at once completely hidden by a quantity of limbs.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Helloa, boys, here comes the major!" exclaimed
            Daggett. "Lay low, Will, till he goes. It won't be
            long."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That rate would pile all the brush there is here in a
            short time," remarked the major, as he stood among the
            men. "It is a good plan, too, to complete the work as
            you go. Here are some limbs which have lain so long
            that they have been grown over by sod. Pile on those
            old poles while you are about it."
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereupon, to Daggett's delight and Archer's dismay,
            the major brought a log larger than any of the hands
            could carry, and placed it upon the brush-heap, which
            was already large.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Have any of you a match?" inquired the major. "I
            believe I will fire this heap."
        </p>
        <p>
            The men looked at each other in alarm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, we haven't," answered Daggett.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why, I have one," said Ratke. "Now let us get
            some of these dry leaves together and we may make it
            burn."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It will not go," remarked the major, as the flame
            flickered and died out. "If I had another match, I could
            start it. "Now, boy, come up and get something for
            that cough."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I don't want anything for that," returned Daggett."
            That will be all right when it comes warm weather."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We must attend to it now," urged Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I guess I won't go," said Daggett, feeling very
            uneasy at this manifestation of his employer's kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What, mutiny?" exclaimed the major, putting his
            arm around the young man and dragging him along.
            "You see that you have no option in the matter."
        </p>
        <p>
            Daggett noticed that the major made no remark about
            Archer's disappearance. He had a suspicion that the
            philosopher, even when he was showing him such marks
            of kindness, understood the faithlessness of him and his
            fellows. Looking back as he was passing through the
            shrubs, he saw a head of wavy black hair emerging from
            a brush-heap and a fist shaken viciously toward him, but
            he kept the discovery to himself.

        <p>
            "Did you get me any letters, Manie?" asked Ratke
            as he met his nieces, who were coming from the barns.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Two of them," answered Manie.
        </p>

            "get Mark something for his cough. I am going into the
            sitting-room to read my letters."
        </p>
        <p>
            The first missive which the major opened bore a Washington
            postmark and read as follows:

                <div class="body">
                    DEAR SIR:- As the commissioner expresses doubt concerning the practical value of your
                    invention, I find it is difficult to obtain a patent. I must receive fifty
                    dollars before I proceed further.

            "The leech!" muttered the major; "he would gorge
            himself with my substance. But let me once get my
            Jerusalem wagon started, and I will bid defiance to patent
            lawyers and creditors. What do I care for the few drops
            the insect gets if their place will soon be supplied by
            a liberal infusion which will send vigor through my
            veins?"

            The effect of the two communications was to produce
            an unwonted depression in the major's spirits. It
            was as if a cloud of whose existence he had been not
            ignorant, but to which he had been inattentive, had
            suddenly by a warning bolt made him give heed to its
            proximity.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter in which direction he turned, he could not
            find a way out of the perplexing difficulty. Schemes
            which were his hope, his very life, demanded money for
            their furtherance. His produce was sold, his pocket-book
            empty, his credit gone. He realized his situation; and, in
            the distance, he felt he saw, approaching, calamities which
            would destroy his dearest projects and involve in ruin
            himself and his household.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Grippin interrupted these miserable reflections by
            saying,
        </p>
        <p>
            "He's in here, William Henry Harrison, if you want to
            see him!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The visitor was William Henry Harrison Hibbard,
            whose first three names had been given him at his birth,
            applied in sport during his boyhood, and used through
            habit when he had reached man's estate. William Henry
            Harrison had fits; and these fits had reduced his mind,
            if not to imbecility, to a state of intelligence considerably
            below mediocrity. The spring before, the Republicans
            of Jefferson township had, for want of better amusement,
            nominated him for constable; and the Democrats had so
            far fallen in with the joke that, though they had a large
            majority, the half-wit was elected.
        </p>
        <p>
            William Henry Harrison was tall and slender, his mouth
            was large, and his hair was light The most conspicuous
            part of his raiment was a long, loose ducking jacket which
            was belted tightly about the waist, and whose lower edges
            flared out from his body like an umbrella top. As this
            was his most expensive article of clothing, and as he never
            wore it except on important occasions, it was by the local
            wits called his official coat.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, William Henry Harrison," inquired the major,
            "do you have a great deal to do as constable?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, not 'nawful sight," answered William Henry
            Harrison.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That was a fine run you made last spring," observed
            Ratke. "I believe you beat Johnny Hemp?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, I lick 'im. I run 'way 'head."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Did you ever arrest anybody or serve a summons? "
            inquired Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Dono, guess not," replied the half-wit.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Probably not," said the major, half to himself. "In
            the machine of law you are a pinion, whirled by the belts
            and pulleys of courts, which are, in turn, propelled by the
            engine of legislation. But you are satisfied with your
            condition, and that is more than can be said of many who
            think themselves your superiors. Content, as you are, with
            your lot, you may as well be a pinion as an engine."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," remarked William Henry Harrison, "engine
            might bust."
        </p>
        <p>
            "By George!" exclaimed the major, "but there is wisdom
            in that. The solid iron pinion can be broken only
            by external forces, while the hollow engine may, itself,
            generate the power by which it is rent. Likewise, the
            humble mind escapes those internal conflicts which bring
            ruin to some of the mightier intellects. William Henry
            Harrison, that, is the wisest remark I have heard in a
            month."
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon this unusual compliment, the author of the saying
            so highly praised grinned, covered his mouth with his
            hand and looked steadily at Ratke for some minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major, tiring of the half-wit's scrutiny, had recourse
            to a stratagem which seldom fails to remind a forgetful
            guest of the object of his visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let me take your hat," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," replied William Henry Harrison, taking his hand
            from his mouth. "I no stay, Misser Green, he git mad."
        </p>
        <p>
            "So you stay with Green yet," observed Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," answered the half-wit; "Misser Green, he git
            me new straw hat I give you this paper."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, it is a paper you are serving on me!" exclaimed
            Ratke. "Make Green give you your regular fee, and tell
            him that constables are not obliged to take straw hats in
            payment for the performance of legal duties."
        </p>
        <p>
            The document proved to be a summons which had been
            issued by Justice Lyman Sparks, in behalf of Josiah Green,
            who had purchased a note due the Buckeye Manufacturing
            Co. of Marlboro, Ohio.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Go back to Josiah Green," said the major, "and tell
            him that you performed your errand. Tell him that I
            bound up his financial wounds when the priest and the
            Levite passed him by. Tell him I lent him money when
            his place was mortgaged for its full value, and no one else
            would trust him. Tell him he owes me yet for a cow and
            wheat which I let him have when his family was sick."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can't 'member so much," said William Henry Harrison,
            alarmed at Ratke's vehemence. "Misser Green he whip.
            Oh! whip big."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Halt," ordered the major, as the unique constable
            moved toward the door. "You have been a faithful
            officer and you have earned your supper. You must eat
            with me. Instead of making Green mad, it will please
            him to think he is relieved from the expense of feeding
            you. Maria rang the saw before you served the summons."
        </p>
        <p>
            "But," said the half-wit, "I can't 'member that you say
            when mad."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You need not try to remember it," was the major's
            answer." You could do so if you could once comprehend
            it, for you have no doubt a preponderance of memory
            over the reflectives. Your mind is not brilliant, and,
            when by accident you stumble upon a sensible expression,
            it shines as forcibly as a bolt of lightning from the
            darkened sky at midnight. Do you understand what I say ?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," answered William Henry Harrison.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is as well that you do not," commented Ratke. "I
            would rather you would not understand all I say, because
            I want to talk, and I do not wish to hurt your feelings.
            Now, I will tell you something which you can understand,
            William Henry Harrison. To-day you have been a
            smarter man than I have."
        </p>
        <p>
            William Henry Harrison was so pleased with Ratke's
            approbation that, at supper, he endeavored to obtain more
            of it by delivering some witty speeches. Disappointed in
            receiving encouragement to continue his remarks, he allowed
            his own appreciation of his sagacity to be visible
            in several prolonged grins, the last of which was frozen
            by one of Mrs. Grippin's frowns.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the meal, as he stood irresolutely in the sitting-room,
            he remarked, "I have fit purty soon. I tell."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will tell Trace to hitch up a horse and take you
            home," said Ratke, hastily passing to the dining-room.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major, returning, found William Henry Harrison
            on the floor, with his limbs alternately contracting and
            expanding to their utmost capacity. The half-wit's eyes
            were rolled back, his face contorted, his figure writhing
            and twisting and his lips covered with froth. On the
            floor about him were the fragments of a large mirror,
            which had cut his hands in several places.
        </p>
        <p>
            When William Henry Harrison had finished his first
            and last official visit, Ratke observed, "The Buckeye
            Company agreed to wait a year for that note. I wonder
            that so careful a man as Green should send such an officer
            as William Henry Harrison."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You needn't wonder," returned Mrs. Grippin. "He
            did it to be mean, just to tantalize you. If it ain't legal,
            he'll send another man with it. Oh, I would like to talk
            to Si Green a minute. I'd like to tell him some things.
            If it hadn't been for you, he'd have starved and his whole
            family. You can get mad if you want to, Nora. I know
            he's your aunt's husband. But that don't make any difference.
            I should think you'd be proud of him, a man
            that's got rich making cider. He's done more harm in
            this neighborhood than he could do good if he should live to
            be as old as Methuselah. Him, a member of the church,
            making cider and selling it to get men drunk."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I wonder how he found out about the note," said the
            major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's that Phleet Takum," replied Mrs. Grippin. "He
            keeps posted on your business better than you do. He
            has done a great deal to destroy your credit."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is strange," remarked the major, "how a man of
            Philetus' ability can do so much harm. I can explain it in
            no way except by the law of virtual velocities: 'Power,
            multiplied by the distance through which it moves, equals
            weight, multiplied by the distance through which it moves. '
            To accomplish a given result, then, a man of half average
            ability must move through twice the space, or, in other
            words, bestir himself twice as much as an ordinary man.
            Here comes Trace. I must see how he left William Henry
            Harrison."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm informed Ratke that he had left William
            Henry Harrison at Green's gate, apparently none the worse
            for his fit.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you know he is an officer of the law?" queried
            the major, as he was unhitching a tug.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, is he?" ejaculated Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The Republicans and part of the Democrats of Jefferson
            township," said Ratke, "disgraced themselves by
            electing that poor idiot boy to the office of constable.
            Today he made his first official visit."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am surprised," commented Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is all I can tell you," said Ratke quickly, feeling
            that he had already said too much. "To succeed in
            business a man must bridle his tongue. If he gives a
            knowledge of his affairs to the gossips, he places them
            before a double convex lens, which may converge the
            heat of public scrutiny to melt his gold, as that metal is
            sometimes melted at a powerful focus."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have no wish to pry into your affairs," replied
            Montcalm. "On the contrary, I am opposed to receiving
            from you any confidence which you may afterward regret."
        </p>
        <p>
            "This much I can tell you. Trace," said Ratke. "The
            constable's errand was not to perform a duty connected
            with criminal law."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I felt assured of that," replied Montcalm. "You
            will never be suspected of crime. I will care for this
            horse if you will tell me how much grain to feed him."
        </p>
        <p>
            It often happens that a skillful investigator will by
            professed indifference lull suspicions of his art and
            extract much information which by any other means he
            would be unable to obtain. This is what was done by
            Montcalm. Ratke thought that he had been boorish with
            the son of his old comrade. He would atone for his
            surliness by a partial explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
            "This is a civil matter," he remarked, "a little debt
            which I owe and which I thought would not be presented
            for collection in a year."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You have been hardly fair with me," said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You have not allowed me to do the chores enough to
            learn them. How much grain do you feed this horse?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Never mind the horse," exclaimed Ratke impatiently.
            "You do not seem to like to listen to me, Trace. I have
            been sued by Green. He has bought a note of twenty
            dollars against me. Not that it is anything serious, but
            some other things unite with it to make up a combination
            which promises me trouble. The farm is sold on the
            mortgage in July."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Your Jerusalem wagon ought to help you out," said
            Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh," replied Ratke. "If I could get my wagon into
            the market, I could pay for my farm. If I could pay for
            my farm, I could get my wagon into the market. Both
            are wedged in the narrow passage of fatality, each waiting
            to be extricated by help from the other. To-day I received
            a letter from my patent lawyer, stating that he
            must have fifty dollars or he could not proceed further
            with the business. I bought a cow of Osborne for thirty
            dollars and I agreed to get her in two weeks. I can muster
            not more than twenty-five dollars with which to meet these
            sums, I own a farm, the Barton hundred and sixty,
            which is east of the county line and which is unencumbered.
            I might mortgage that, but I hate to do it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Is that the extent of your trouble?" asked Montcalm.
            "I can lend you one hundred dollars. Last week I got
            my quarterly dividend on a one-thousand-dollar share of
            stock."
        </p>
        <p>
            "One thousand dollars!" cried the major. "One
            thousand dollars surely cannot bring a quarterly dividend
            of one hundred dollars."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The quarterly dividend is one hundred and fifty," said
            Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "In what kind of stock have you invested ?" queried
            Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That I am not at liberty to tell," responded Montcalm.
            "Every member of the company is bound to keep its
            operations secret."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Get out of it as soon as you can," advised Ratke.
            "It is fraudulent, or there would be no need of
            secrecy."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will do so at once," acquiesced Montcalm. "At the
            next quarter I will withdraw my capital."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am suspicious of such organizations," said Ratke.
            "Did you ever hear of Nijni Novgorod oats?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I never did," replied Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That," pursued Ratke, "was the most successful
            swindle which was ever worked on the farmers of
            Michigan. For every bushel of grain which the company
            sold to a farmer, it received ten dollars and agreed to sell
            for him the next year twice that quantity at the same
            price, minus the agent's fee of twenty-five per cent.
            Thus, for each bushel of grain the farmer bought, he gave
            ten dollars and got fifteen. He was bound by agreement
            not to sell the oats for less than they cost him. Jackson
            County went wild over the speculation. As the Nijni
            Novgorod fellows gave credit and took notes for pay,
            every one had means to invest.
        </p>
        <p>
            "After harvest the agents were not to be found.
            Then the crisis came. The notes had passed into the
            hands of those whom the law calls innocent purchasers
            and, of course, had to be paid. Men put their property
            out of their hands to avoid payment. Jasper Smith, a
            prosperous farmer who had been defrauded to the amount
            of twelve hundred dollars, hung himself in his own barn.
            Yet this lesson, severe as it was, did not educate the
            people. They would seize with avidity the next chance
            to be swindled."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will get out of the company at the next quarter,"
            assured Montcalm. "By that time I shall have doubled
            my investment."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I would not be too fast," said the major. "But
            they will never draw me into the scheme. I would like
            to have one of their agents come here. I would give him
            a snub which he would not soon forget."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The company will not attempt to inveigle you," replied
            Montcalm. "It does not send out agents. It wishes
            to be composed of those only who are now its members."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How clannish!" Ratke exclaimed, "to want to keep
            a good thing all to itself. I have no patience with such
            companies. You can tell me something of its nature
            Trace?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Not without a permit from the president and directors,"
            answered Montcalm. "I must keep my promise
            of secrecy, even though I offend my father's friend and
            mine."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Break your promise to no one," said Ratke. "But
            you can write to them for permission to impart the
            knowledge I wish?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "They may not like to let you know," suggested Montcalm.
            "Nevertheless, I will write."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will risk it," replied the major. "They would give
            me permission to join if I desired to do so. Now, I have
            no wish to join you. But you write and ask them if I
            may. I will wager a box of cigars that they will accept
            me as a member."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Done," said Montcalm," and I will show you their
            answer. I am certain of my cigars, however. They will
            admit no new members."
        </p>
        <p>
            "They are very exclusive," commented the major.
            "Are they afraid of contamination from the common
            people? None of them have better blood than I. My
            ancestor, Johann Ratke, was a grandson of Martin
            Gerard, the uncle of Erasmus. What king of the fourteenth
            century wielded a more powerful and more enduring
            scepter than the philosopher of Rotterdam?"

        <p>
            The next Sunday was cloudy and cold. The raw west
            wind swept along stray flakes of snow in almost horizontal
            lines. Saturday Wingscheut had hailed the sight of a
            chipmunk as a certain omen of immediate spring; and this
            bleak Sabbath had followed, as if the very elements
            delighted to disprove the predictions of the false prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
            For six successive days Mrs. Grippin had been indulging
            in regret and blame for their absence from church the
            previous Sunday: regret for the rain which had furnished
            an excuse for non-attendance, blame for the inconsistency
            of the boastful soldier and philosopher, who bragged of
            indifference to red-hot cannon balls, and yet was afraid of a
            few little drops of cold water.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these trials the major had his consolation. It was
            the common lot of philosophers to be censured and
            abused. Did not Guericke suffer from popular ignorance
            and prejudice? Was not Galileo assailed and even
            obliged to retract his theories? And had not Socrates
            his Xantippe, the prototype of Mrs. Grippin?
        </p>
        <p>
            The church, which was of good size, considering its
            country location, stood on a slight elevation, about
            three-fourths of a mile west of the Ratke dwelling. Between
            the edifices the ground curved and merged in a miniature
            valley which occupied most of the distance. Southwest
            of the house of worship were the farm buildings and cider
            mill of Josiah Green, who held the mortgage on the
            major's estate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pastor, a man quick to discover motes and beams
            in the eyes of his congregation, and ready to grab at the
            offending particle or bulk the instant of its discovery, had
            prepared a philippic for the special benefit of Green.
        </p>
        <p>
            His text was Romans fourteenth chapter and twenty-first
            verse: "It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink
            wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is
            offended, or is made weak."
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting from the premise that each one, in a measure,
            molds the character of his neighbor, he launched boldly
            into the theme of man's responsibility for the conduct of
            his fellows.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is it that we are to refrain from doing ? Anything,
            remember, anything, by which our brother stumbleth,
            or is offended, or is made weak.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That which injures our brother maybe quite harmless
            to ourselves. Nevertheless, if it diminishes his virtue or
            his faith, we should avoid it, even though the degree of
            decline be so slight that it is visible only by Him on
            whom that faith is fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "One of God's people, if he were not in the trammels of
            Church discipline, might be placed in such circumstances
            that he could dance without moral degeneration. But
            if, thereby, his brother is led into bad company, if
            possible converts avoid a faith whose votaries seem insincere,
            it is his duty to lop off the pleasure, even though it be
            dear as his right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Card-playing could be indulged in without sin, provided
            we were sure that no sinful consequences would follow
            the game. There is no contamination in the pictures
            or the card-board. The queen of clubs does not look
            wholly depraved. The king of hearts, though his appearance
            is not prepossessing, is too lazy and inefficient to be a
            power for evil. Bibles which carry a knowledge of the
            Saviour to the center of barbarism, are made from the
            same material as spades and aces. But for all that,
            card-playing entices to evil. Card-playing should be
            tolerated in no Christian or moral home.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Who will say that there is evil in a glass of cider which
            is guaranteed never to touch the lips of man? Yet, cider
            is the greatest curse which this community has ever seen.
            More, than beer, more than whisky, more than the horse-thieves,
            against whom so many anathemas have been breathed, cider
            is bringing its awful harvest of pain and crime. But in
            this congregation, --- for I see them now, ---
            are men in whose cellars are cider barrels, whose sons,
            following their father's lead, descend the stairs, turn the
            faucet and change themselves into receptacles of the potion
            which would make fiends of angels. Ay, brethren, I
            see those who manufacture the damning beverage
            poured into the throats of topers and of boys now unpolluted,
            to lure them on to places of infamy, to leave them
            helplessly wallowing in the mire of debauchery and whiskey,
            for whisky is the natural successor of cider. And these
            men, together with their victims, are descending to the
            lake of fire and brimstone, not on a stream of pure water
            reflecting the sunlight from its sandy bed, but along a
            river of yellow cider reeking with the smell of rotten
            pomace and of dead men's bones."
        </p>
        <p>
            The rural preacher supported the above denunciation
            by awkward gestures and a high degree of earnestness.
            Green's manner, while he was receiving in addition to this
            chastisement the glances of most of the congregation, was
            less perturbed than usual. He was a spare, nervous man
            of medium height. It was his custom in church often to
            look out of the window, to cross and recross his legs and
            to show other signs of restlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this occasion, leaning his elbows on the back of the
            pew in front of him, he looked steadily at the preacher
            He appeared heartily to indorse the sermon and to have
            no suspicion that it was intended for him; and, when he
            received a bolt more crushing than its predecessor, he
            smiled, as if approving the condemnation which was to be
            meted out to some other man.
        </p>
        <p>
            In class meeting he rose as he had done nearly
            Sunday for a dozen years, said a few words hastily, and
            sat down with the air of one who rejoices that he has
            finished an unpleasant duty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm was invited to a position in the choir as
            he and Manie sang from the same book, many a rustic
            swain shared the jealousy of Wrengell.
        </p>
        <p>
            After class meeting Lyman Sparks arose to make "a
            sejestion."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There's one thing we forgot about, brothers and sisters
            the donation to Brother Osborne's. We ain't made any
            pervision for the needcessties o'the 'casion. Of course,
            there'll be some needcessties, an' we ought to make some
            pervision for 'em. I motion that we have a committee
            o'three to pervide for the 'casion."
        </p>
        <p>
            When the motion had been passed, Mr. Sparks again
            arose.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I sejest the names o' Brother Osborne, Brother Green
            an', well, mebbe I've said enough. I don't want to have
            too much to say about this thing. Somebody else sejest
            another name."
        </p>
        <p>
            Sparks was chosen as the last committee man, the
            benediction was pronounced and the people dispersed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'd like to see Lime Sparks tell me what to cook,"
            said Mrs. Grippin, as she was on her way home, "or Si
            Green. If they come poking their noses around where
            I'm cooking, they'll get out, that's all."
        </p>
        <p>
            In the afternoon, while the rest of the family were out
            at church, Nora entertained Fred Loomis, the clerk in Dr.
            Rorus' drug-store at Break o'Day. Loomis was stylishly
            attired. He had town manners, a slight frame, and an
            equally slight mustache. On matters of dress and general
            deportment, he trusted his judgment implicitly, but, in
            conversation which required the higher attributes of mind,
            he felt his weakness. Often, when he thought a remark
            or circumstance amusing, he suppressed a laugh until one
            of his associates demonstrated by example the propriety
            of its indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
            When evening came, this village dandy, Nora, Manie
            and Montcalm were in the parlor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clerk and Nora on a couch whispered and giggled,
            while Manie and Montcalm, in a further corner of the
            room, maintained less secrecy and more dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is a fine likeness," observed Montcalm, pointing
            to a portrait of a man who had a broad, high brow, large,
            expressive eyes and a stern, intellectual face. "Every
            boy knows Senator Mallard's picture. One can almost
            think that he sees the words of his last great speech issuing
            from those firm-set lips. He is a recognized champion
            in debate."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," said Manie. "He and Uncle James were classmates
            at college. He has visited us several times since
            I can remember. Uncle James is a Democrat, you know,
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time Senator Mallard comes they engage in a hot
            political discussion, which Uncle James begins, unmindful
            of his previous defeats. Uncle James says he is the only
            man who ever conquered him fairly in argument."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Conquest by him is no disgrace," returned Montcalm.
            "It is the common fate of those who oppose him. Will
            you please favor us with a song or some instrumental
            music? A love of the beautiful is the very origin of music,
            and it is what you have shown in the decoration of this
            room. The cheap and the gorgeous you have eschewed,
            while you have drawn liberally from unpretentious and
            intrinsic beauty. The picture at the right of the mirror
            is an illustration of my statement. Here we have, well
            portrayed, a pleasing scene in rural life, a fine house and
            barn, with mountains looming up in the background.
            See how neat everything is about the place."
        </p>

            "Everything is unnaturally neat and proper," replied
            Manie. "The horses' heads are too high. The sheep
            are too large, and that cow looks as if she were posing for
            a picture. Nobody ever saw so square and high a load of
            hay as that one going into the barn. The man on it is
            standing so straight that he will bump his head unless
            he stoops. The artist could have improved the picture
            by tipping over one of the lightning-rods and tearing down
            a gate."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It need not show slovenliness to be accurate," Montcalm
            answered;" I acknowledge your superiority in logic,
            but I still contend that I am right."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Allow me to give you a compliment in return," said
            Manie. "You would make an excellent lightning-rod
            agent. Every man you met would have fat hogs, blooded
            cattle or smart children. Get your note-book and I will
            give you a list of flattering remarks which would insure a
            sale.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Compliment one, Intelligent farmer. Compliment two,
            Large chickens. Compliment three, Smart children. But,
            if your pleasing speeches are addressed to a lady, do not
            have them.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Compliment one, Robust and healthful. Compliment
            two, Fragile and delicate."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am wounded by the lash of sarcasm," said Montcalm. "Each
            neighborhood has its local satirist, pouring
            out MacFlecknoes and Dunciads on hapless Shadwells
            and Gibbers. This character, varying in sagacity and
            bitterness, according to training and original talent, native
            cheerfulness and the world's usage, is a necessity to progress.
            No great reform is accomplished without his help.
            Whenever society moves slowly in its duty, he strikes the
            hindmost; and though the laggard may not afterward be
            found in the front of the procession, he is apt to abandon
            the position of rear-guard to another, who in turn finds it
            an inconvenient and dangerous post. But I will not class
            you with the common satirist, for you have shown more
            refined talent than he. You have been taking lessons of
            Pope, Juvenal and Swift."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, you are losing your art, Mr. Montcalm," said
            Manie. "First, you ascribe to me the most delicate sensibility,
            and now you class me with as vulgar a satirist as
            Swift. Do you think I would write the, 'Tale of a Tub'?
            I am glad that, if I have not the genius to compose
            the Dunciad, neither have I the vindictive spirit which
            prompted it. You should memorize your flattering statements,
            and then they would not conflict."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, I am hit sorely and wantonly," said Montcalm.
            "How often have I been proceeding carelessly, if not unwittingly,
            in error when I felt a smarting, agonizing blow;
            and I knew that I had been struck by that scourge of
            scourges, that whip of scorpions, the lash of the local satirist.
            Then, I sometimes encased myself in the armor of
            reasoning and excuse, and, confident in my protecting
            mail, took up my old line of march. But a certain man (or
            woman) drew a bow at a venture, and behold, Ahab was
            smitten between the joints of the harness."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If Ahab would avoid the fatal arrow," returned Manie,
            "he should shun the field of Ramoth Gilead, or, better
            still, he should not make covenants with Ben-hadad."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Make covenants with Ben-hadad?", said Montcalm,
            nervously turning his head. "What does that mean?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ahab did not enter into an offensive and defensive
            alliance with Ben-hadad," Manie replied. "He merely
            spared the life of the wicked Syrian when he had him in
            his power. He who compromises with, or refuses to
            attack error, commits the sin of Ahab; and he will meet
            his punishment as surely as did the son of Omri."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Then every man who temporizes with evil will meet a
            bloody death?" queried Montcalm with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You must not infer that," answered Manie. "As the
            sin differs in some respects from that of Ahab, so in all
            probability will the punishment. But he who permits the
            perpetration of an evil which he can prevent will not be
            held guiltless. To that man, in some way, in time or
            eternity, Ramoth Gilead must come."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm saw that, whatever his ability in compliment,
            Manie was more than his equal in argument, He determined
            now to abandon the contest, which he would not so
            long have continued had he not wished to give her the
            flattering opinion of her own skill as a controversialist.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Give Ahab a truce," he said. "The donation at Mr.
            Osborne's is next Friday night. Mr. Sparks advised us
            to make 'pervision for the needcessties o' the 'casion.'
            My chief 'needcessty' is a companion for the evening.
            May wicked Ahab presume to ask you to ride in his
            chariot?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh! I'm a-going to have some fun!" exclaimed
            Nora, jumping up and rushing to the sitting-room.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is she going to do?" asked Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nobody knows what she is going to do," Manie answered.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a few minutes Nora returned, bringing with her
            Archer. The hired man, whose body was encased in a
            blue coat with large brass buttons, strode into the room,
            carrying his head and shoulders very erect.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good-evening, Mrs. Ratke," he said with a profound
            bow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Archer in his youth had been taught that a married
            lady's proper title is Mrs.; and he had broadened this
            definition until he made it embrace every member of the
            sex, whether married or unmarried.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, Mr. Archer," said Nora, "we're so glad you've
            come. We want you to sing for us."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well," responded Archer, tipping back his chair and
            spreading the sides of his coat wide apart with his hands,
            at the same time taking care that the brass buttons should
            be conspicuous, "I don't pretend to be much of a singician,
            but folks used to say I could sing."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Of course you can sing," persisted Nora. "Good
            singers do have to be urged so. Fred can't sing bass,
            and Mr. Montcalm can't sing it, and so we want you to.
            Now, Mr. Archer, don't make any more excuses, but go
            right up and help them sing."
        </p>
        <p>
            Manie much against her will went to the organ and assisted
            Montcalm and Archer to sing "The Sweet By-and-By."
        </p>
        <p>
            Archer, maintaining the same pitch throughout the
            hymn, tapped the floor with his foot, bobbed his head
            from side to side, and without any approach to a tune
            rumbled away with all his might.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nora's enjoyment of the scene was well-nigh perfect.
            She clapped her hands, rolled over on the sofa and, but
            for Archer's monotonous "By-and-By, By-and-By," would
            certainly have been heard by him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, that was splendid, Mr. Archer," she cried, when
            the hymn was concluded. "I wish I could sing like that.
            Now give us a song, please."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What kind of a song, Mrs. Warfle?" Archer inquired.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Something sentimental," answered Nora. "That's
            what we would all like to hear."
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus encouraged, Archer began to sing a narrative, most
            of which on account of its tedious length must be briefly
            told in prose.

            When he was twenty years old, after receiving a call to

            </div>
        </div>

        Her affections blighted, the maiden pined steadily away,
        and an anxious friend made the following inquiry:
        <div class="poetry-container">
            <div class="poetry">
                <div class="stanza">
                    <div class="verse">"Madam, what makes you look so pale?</div>

            On this solicitation the maiden, telling the story of her
            love, imparted a warning to those who interfere with affairs
            of the heart, and at the close of the injunction gave
            a wail of agony and expired. The parents, stricken with
            grief at their loss, sent for the minister's son.

            "Oh, dear! Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, dear!" ejaculated
            Nora, making no attempt to conceal her mirth while
            the clerk, as he thought, very properly seconded, with
            less effusiveness, her demonstrations of glee. "Oh!
            that's awful good, Mr. Archer. That's splendid. Oh!
            my! Oh, dear! 'Sometimes they die and oft do grieve.'
            What! You're not going now, are you?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, it's getting along towards bedtime," returned
            Archer, whose perception, though dull, was still acute
            enough to show him that he was being made the butt of
            ridicule.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is too bad," said Manie, when Archer had gone.
            "I am ashamed of you, Nora. You have no right to hurt
            people's feelings in that way."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Preach all you want to," retorted Nora.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Won't you do an errand for me?" she asked, accosting
            Archer, who had not yet taken his departure from the
            house, and whose countenance suggested that he was in ill
            humor from the treatment which he had received.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well?" answered the hired man gruffly.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I wish you would tell Mr. Wrengell to come up here,"
            said Nora.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'll see," returned Archer in a tone which showed that
            he had no intention to oblige her.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, please, Mr. Archer," pleaded Nora. "I do so
            want to see him. Tell him, and I'll remember it a long
            while, and I'll think how good you was. Won't you, Mr.
            Archer?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, yes," said Archer hesitatingly, "I'll tell him."
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrengell was surprised at the summons which he received.
            Without waiting to make some needed changes
            in his apparel he started, and soon stood in the
            dining-room, embarrassed and expectant.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There are some young folks in the parlor," explained
            Nora. "We want you to join us."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I can't possibly."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, you can," said Nora, taking his sleeve and pulling
            him gently along." There is nobody in the house that
            will hurt you. Come on, now, without any more excuses."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't you go into any of your nonsense, Nora," said
            Mrs. Grippin, as they passed through the sitting-room.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major without the knowledge of Mrs. Grippin had
            placed in one of the parlor bedrooms a chair, the rounds
            of which had been broken. Nora, quickly slipping into
            the bedroom, brought out the superannuated piece of
            furniture for Wrengell, who was too embarrassed to notice
            the maneuver. At the instant he sat down, however, the
            spreading chair legs and descending cane bottom warned
            him of the insecurity of his position and compelled him to
            bear most of the weight of his body on his legs.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Won't you sing us a song, Mr. Wrengell?" said Nora
            with a giggle, which was echoed by the clerk.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I do not care to sing," answered Wrengell, now
            comprehending her motive in enticing him to the parlor.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, please, do sing us something sentimental," said
            Nora, interspersing now and then a smothered laugh between
            the words, "something about somebody that--that
            died for--for love, you know."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sing something of your own selection," suggested
            Manie, endeavoring by kindly encouragement to atone for
            Nora's misdemeanor.
        </p>
        <p>
            On hearing this invitation Wrengell came to the conclusion
            that the company had entered into a conspiracy
            to make him appear ridiculous; and his embarrassment
            was quickly supplanted by anger.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thank you, I do not care to sing," he responded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Perhaps you will play for us," said Manie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Springing to his feet, with such violence that the rickety
            chair spread out its loose-jointed legs and squatted nearly
            to the floor, Wrengell went quickly to the organ.
        </p>
        <p>
            The instrument broke forth into a roar of wrath. It
            seemed to bid defiance to the company, to tell them that
            the man whom they had insulted was above and indifferent
            to their sneers. Gradually the notes decreased in
            volume and increased in rapidity, until the sounds appeared
            almost to coalesce; yet not once did the fingers
            of the player err in the selection of a key or appear to
            move more swiftly than their normal gait.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such a manifestation of proficiency where none was
            expected filled the four auditors with astonishment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manie and Montcalm listened in admiration, Nora
            opened her mouth in surprise, while the shallow clerk
            glanced at her to ascertain if he were to grin again at
            Wrengell's expense.
        </p>
        <p>
            With exquisite modulation Wrengell changed the music
            from anger to solemnity and from solemnity to pathos;
            and he brought out with unusual distinctness that one
            superiority of instrumental over vocal music, its
            application to individual thought without the
            circumscription of language.
        </p>
        <p>
            A song beautiful in conception and glowing with power
            often fails to produce an impression, because he for whom
            it is rendered finds in it nothing which coincides with his
            sympathies or experience. But he who hears a well-played
            instrumental has no assurance that it was not composed for
            the benefit of his special class. To the resigned sufferer
            the solemn largissimo may be a strain of patient resignation,
            while to the misanthrope it is the wail of hopeless
            despair. The sparkling brillante, which animates one to
            heroic deeds and lofty aims, fills another with dreams of
            the revel and the debauch.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was impossible to tell in what channel moved the
            reflections of Manie and Montcalm, who, alone of those
            present, were capable of appreciating the skill of the
            musician. But whether they were impelled to noble or
            to base purposes, they were moved, in no common degree,
            by those finer variations, those nicer shades of expression
            which distinguish the touch of the master from mere
            agility and correctness of movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrengell rose from the organ with as much suddenness
            as he had approached it, and, determined to show his
            indifference to their opinions, he left the parlor, casting
            back a look of contempt, which he meant to include every
            person in the room. Passing through the sitting-room,
            where the major and Mrs. Grippin were engaged in a
            controversy, deliberate on the one side and furious on the
            other, he went through the dining-room, the kitchen and
            into the open air.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was with dejection that Wrengell entered the chamber
            of the club-house and seated himself on the only unoccupied
            bed. The affront which had been given him in
            the major's parlor was by no means the first which he had
            been compelled to bear. From his infancy disgrace had
            been his lot. He had been told the story of his drunken
            parents, of his mother who was sent to the penitentiary,
            of his father who wandered to a distant state, there to be
            imprisoned for some offense the details of which were
            forgotten but the commission of which was being frequently
            recalled. Taken from a poorhouse at an early age by a
            farmer, who was ever reminding him of the charity, he
            strove manfully to repay the debt which, he fancied, he
            owed. He was given severe tasks to perform; and the
            story of his degradation was spread broadcast by the man
            with whom he lived, to such an extent that he was publicly
            shunned.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he was unable to bear the exactions of his foster-father,
            Wrengell left the shelter of his roof and turned his
            attention to his neglected education. Working between
            terms and studying nights, he made excellent progress;
            and, at the time he commenced work for Ratke, he had
            gone half through college and had taken the greater part
            of a thorough musical course.
        </p>
        <p>
            And this boy, without wealth, with a lineage so mean
            that its very mention gave him shame, was proud, proud
            as they who openly ignored him, proud as that greater
            number who recognized his title to acquaintanceship, but
            drew between him and them a barrier which, more felt
            than seen, prevented the relations of intimate friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slowly he drew off one shoe and bared his left foot.
            It was not a perfect member. The main part of the foot
            was symmetrical, but from the outer edge branched a
            sixth toe, which increased in size the extremity of the limb
            and made a small protuberance appear on the surface of
            the shoe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrengell looked down at the malformation with a feeling
            almost of hatred. How often in his childhood, when,
            before he was large enough to work, he went barefooted
            to school, had his companions pointed sneeringly at his
            deformity. The drunken father, the depraved mother,
            the sixth toe he had considered component parts of his
            disgrace.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had thought that, far from the associations of his
            youth, he might escape the obloquy which had weighed
            him down. He believed that the mark of shame was upon
            him, that it was visible to whomsoever he met, that it had
            been seen by the Ratkes, and that by them he was despised.
        </p>
        <p>
            Archer had been by common consent relegated to the
            farther corner of the room, and was there snoring
            comfortably, and noisily. Wrengell, knowing that no common
            circumstance would awaken the slumberer, went to his
            bedside, and, taking down his violin, which hung over his
            head, commenced to play a lively air. The music had
            been in progress not a minute, when the loud talking on
            the ground floor ceased, and Brown called "Helloa! what's
            the racket up there, Will? Less go up, boys," he added
            as the playing continued.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrengell had barely time to throw down the violin and
            get into bed before the men were in the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He's learned a new piece," said Daggett, "and he's
            improved mightily."
        </p>
        <p>
            "'Stonishin'," remarked the Canadian, Thompson.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why, boys," exclaimed Daggett, as the sleeper exhaled
            a deeply rumbling current of air, "he's asleep."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Did he play that in his sleep?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "He must of," replied Brown.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Less wake him up," said Daggett.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I tell you vat," observed Wingscheut, "you can push
            unt you can pull, put tey can't no man vake up Vill
            Archer."
        </p>
        <p>
            Straws, snuff and pepper were applied to his nose, but
            their sole effect was to make him give uneasy sniffs and
            change his position.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Say," exclaimed Brown, dragging him half out of bed
            and at last getting the sleepy eyelids to unclose, "why
            don't you play like that when you're awake?"
        </p>

            CHAPTER VI.<br>
            <small>THE GUERRERO MINING COMPANY.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            It was a model spring day. The snow had quite disappeared,
            and the ground was relieved of its superabundant
            moisture so nearly that the roads were in fair condition
            for the passage of teams. Ratke's barnyard, tracked up
            by the stock, was a lone quagmire, surrounded by stretches
            of solid earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm had just returned from Break o'Day, where
            the major had sent him for the mail. Ratke, wishing to
            avoid the unpleasant observation of Mrs. Grippin, made a
            detour and reached the barns in time to help him unhitch
            the horse.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here are your cigars," said Montcalm, extending a
            wooden box as Ratke drew near.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What cigars?" asked the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you not remember?" Montcalm queried; "you bet
            me a box of cigars that the company to which I belong
            would accept you as a member? I felt sure of the wager,
            but you have won it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You should have known better than to bet with me,"
            said the major, taking the cigars. "I have seen more of
            the world than you have."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have discovered that to my cost," replied Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am anxious to hear the revelation which the company
            allows you to make," said the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Very well," said Montcalm, "but first you must sign
            this agreement not to disclose the information you receive.
            It is a mining company," said Montcalm, when Ratke had
            signed the printed agreement, "and is located in the
            province of Guerrero, Mexico. Two miners of Chicago
            got tired of prospecting out West and finally went
            southward. South of the city of Mexico they found what
            they believed to be rich diggings. They returned to
            Chicago and interested some men of moderate means, who
            formed the Guerrero Mining Company. In their excavations
            they came upon many curious relics, such as pottery,
            weapons and bodily ornaments. They exhumed a skeleton
            seven feet in length, with silver bracelets on its arms and
            ornaments of the same metal on its legs. The scientific
            men have disputed as to the date of its interment.
            Professor McDowell claims it is the remains of an Anahuac
            who lived previous to the union of that tribe with the
            Chicimecs, while Dr. Hartsuff is equally positive that it is
            a relic of the ante-Toltec period. Professor McDowell is
            writing a work on the ancient races, which he intends to
            publish as soon as the existence of the mines is generally
            known. What is your opinion on the subject, Major?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "We will discuss that some other time," replied the
            major, who was not particularly well posted on American
            aboriginal history, and who wished to consult his
            authorities before committing himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here is the letter which they wrote me," said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "They seem like candid fellows," remarked the major,
            after perusing the missive. "Notice that, Trace.
        </p>
        <p>
            "'Major Ratke's reputation as a veteran of the Mexican
            war is such that we are not afraid to trust him with the
            knowledge he wishes. A new mine has been opened, and
            we can let him have one share of stock, provided he sends
            us his application for membership as soon as the fourteenth
            of March.'
        </p>
        <p>
            "You see," continued the major, "they have heard of
            me. The people are beginning to revere the veterans of
            the Mexican war. But they have picked up specific
            information about me. Are there any of my old comrades
            in the company?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I do not know," replied Montcalm. "They may have
            read in the histories of your military exploits."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," said the major; "my name was mentioned in the
            newspapers which gave an account of the war period, but
            it never appeared in history. Tell me something more
            about your company."
        </p>
        <p>
            "All its members whom I know," said Montcalm, "are
            men whose characters are beyond reproach. They wish
            to keep the knowledge of the mines from the money kings,
            until they have occupied the best diggings. They pay a
            quarterly dividend of fifteen per cent, on the capital. That
            is sixty percent, yearly. Mr. Bruce, a friend of mine, who
            used to live in Cortland, gave me the chance of membership."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I like your company," said the major, "because of
            the men of culture who are in it and who prop it with
            respectability. Where are you going, Trace?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "To the woods," answered Montcalm. "I have not
            yet worked up that old tree-top."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is the use of your being in such a hurry?" asked
            the major impatiently. "You have not told me all about
            the mining enterprise."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will do so at noon, to the best of my ability."
        </p>
        <p>
            "One thing troubles me," said Ratke, "and that is the
            mortgage on my place. Unless relief comes, the farm
            must be sold in July. I hoped that I might die where I
            had lived in the prime of manhood. Here I have planned
            and worked. In that tool-house have been generated
            those mental children, whose births have cost me the
            pangs of labor, whose nurture and development have been
            my constant care, and which, I had hoped, would be the
            comfort of my declining years. If I am to be driven from
            my home, it would be a solace to know that that building
            will be pointed out as the one in which were cradled the
            creations of a mighty inventive genius."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I trust that you will not be reduced to so poor a
            consolation," said Montcalm. "My father was heavily in
            debt, and he paid the mortgage on his place."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How did he manage it?" inquired Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The mortgage so nearly covered the real value of the
            property," answered Montcalm, "that it was difficult for
            him to obtain the money. He was obliged to give his
            creditor a deed of the farm and take a bond for the
            deed."
        </p>
        <p>
            "A bond?" queried Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," responded Montcalm; "his creditor bound himself
            by a forfeit of $20,000, to deed back the property,
            provided the debt was paid at the specified time. My
            father cleared the place of the incumbrance in three
            years."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If I could get such a chance," said the major, "I
            would accept it. Of course it would be a risk. But,
            unless something is done, I am certain to lose everything.
            Times are hard, and nothing will sell now. Land would
            bring a very low price if it were put up at auction. In
            case my property must go, I would rather see it pass into
            other hands than Green's. Stay a little longer. Trace."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am paid for my time," answered Montcalm firmly,
            "and I must improve it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Just like your father," said the major. "Nothing ever
            kept him from duty. Well, since you will go, I will make
            it as easy as possible for you. You can take the one-man
            saw."
        </p>
        <p>
            After Montcalm's departure to the woods, Ratke seated
            himself on a log which was on the south side of the
            central barn. The sun, whose warming rays are most
            appreciated after a hard winter, beat down with just
            enough heat to make the position one of comfort. The major,
            enjoying the delightful temperature of the place, glanced
            upward to note the spot where the lines of heat struck the
            barn-boards and were reflected downward to him. He
            located the angle of reflection formed by that most pleas-
            ing ray which touched the back of his neck. It was above
            and at the right of a protruding nail and under and to the
            left of an oval knot. This done, he traced out the normal
            which with the perpendicular completed the plane of
            reflection. He estimated how far away must be an object
            which interrupts the sun's rays, to produce a cold wave
            sixty seconds from the time of interruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opposite to his dwelling the hired men were engaged
            in the work of transferring the hill to the quagmire. Some
            of them were laboring faithfully enough. There were,
            however, two notable exceptions. Wingscheut and
            Archer, on the sunny slope of the elevation, out of sight
            of the house and, in their opinion, of the major, were
            seated on the ground kicking up the dirt with their heels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ratke wished that he could bar from them temporarily
            the calorific or heat rays of the sun, so that the mild
            climate of the hillside would be changed to the frigidity
            of winter. How he would enjoy watching them as the gradual
            decline in temperature came on. They would slap
            their hands and stamp with their feet and put off the
            hardship of work as long as they could, but they would have
            to -- yes, they would have to, get up and shovel or freeze.
            Then, when they were industriously at their work, he would
            remove the obstacle and let the pleasant warmth again
            stream down upon them. Of course there would be a
            relapse of laziness and a consequent reapplication of the
            remedy, but they would soon learn that friction develops
            heat, that there was a relation between the action of the
            shovel and the transmission of the calorific rays, and he
            would have the power of securing efficient service from his
            hired men.
        </p>
        <p>
            A foreign body passed between him and the scene of
            labor. To the preoccupied major the object seemed to
            divide, the under and larger piece remaining stationary,
            while the upper portion fell off and continued to advance.
            With an effort the major drew his attention from the hill
            and recognized Durgenson, a cattle-buyer and dealer in
            agricultural implements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Durgenson also dealt occasionally in horses and sheep,
            and was well liked in the community for his square
            dealing, his readiness to accommodate and his frank,
            jocular manner. The only thing which had ever blackened his
            good name in that region was his rumored connection with
            the Nijni Novgorod oat scheme, but he had demonstrated
            to the satisfaction of the farmers that he was guiltless of
            complicity in the fraud. He was a large, square-shouldered
            man with a closely-trimmed, full beard which gave
            him an appearance sterner at a distance than in close
            proximity.
        </p>
        <p>
            "How is everything, Major?" he said, with the heartiness
            which had made him popular among the rural classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ratke, resolved to reap some advantage from the intrusion
            on his meditations, broached to the cattle-buyer the
            subject of a loan.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't hardly know what to tell you. Major," responded
            Durgenson. "I'd like to accommodate. I would. But I don't
            see how I can now. Can't you get the money of Berry?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have been to Berry," answered Ratke, "and I have
            been to every moneyed man in the county. They all
            talk as you do. It will be no risk to you. I will give you
            a deed of the farm; and you on your part must sign a
            bond to deed it back provided the money is paid at the
            specified time."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't see how I can help you, Major," said Durgenson.
            "I couldn't let you have a loan any longer than
            August. That is, I wouldn't agree to, for I'm thinking
            I'll want to use my cash then. That wouldn't pay you at
            all. You might better get it of some one that can wait."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There are no such men in this vicinity," returned
            Ratke. "You can let me have it until August, you say.
            That may be long enough to save me. Whatever happens,
            I do not want the place to go on the mortgage, for I
            cannot endure it to be gloated over by Green. I tell you,
            Durgenson, I am crowded to the wall, and, unless I
            get help, I shall be ruined. I will pay you twenty per
            cent interest and secure you so that you can lose nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I don't want your twenty per cent," said Durgenson.
            "Seven will do me. If I can accommodate you, I'll
            be glad. That's all. Of course I'll have to have the
            bond just as we talked. Maybe I can let you have it four
            or five years. It depends altogether on whether I get in
            a pinch or not. I shall have to draw up the papers to
            make it payable in July."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is satisfactory to me," said the major. "Suppose
            we meet at Sparks's to draw up the writings this afternoon."
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," responded Durgenson. "By the way, have
            you any fat cattle to sell?"
        </p>
        <p>
            As the major had no cattle of any description to sell,
            Durgenson took his departure.
        </p>
        <p>
            That afternoon in the office of Justice Sparks James
            Ratke signed the instrument which gave sections fourteen
            and twenty-three and the north half of section eleven to
            Hiram B. Durgenson, his heirs and assigns forever. The
            major's hand moved unwillingly as he took the pen. The
            word "forever" in capitals looked to him unnecessarily
            large. He had hitherto refrained from placing an
            incumbrance on the Barton hundred and sixty. But after the
            deeding away of the larger part of his property, he went
            to Break o'Day and, that he might invest in the Guerrero
            Mining Company, mortgaged this, the last of his real
            estate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Returning to his home, he found Mrs. Grippin and
            Manie getting a basket of cakes and pies in readiness for
            the donation, which was to be held that night.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manie had accepted the offer of Montcalm's service as
            escort. Nora, disappointed in securing the attention of
            Fred Loomis, had acquainted Manie with her trouble, and
            that model of cousins had exercised her influence on the
            major, who had invited John Wrengell to ride in the wagon
            with the family. So it happened that Nora and he whose
            awkwardness she had mercilessly ridiculed not a week
            before sat side by side during the journey to Osborne's.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major soon after his arrival at Osborne's met a
            reverse in his favorite warfare, argument. Lyman Sparks
            had brought with him Largess, a nephew of his wife and the
            principal of the Sharptown Academy, who, according to
            the rural custom, was honored with the title of "Professor."
            Professor Largess was an atheist; and the pride of
            the Sparks' who were professed Christians, was raised more
            by the proficiency of their relative in debate than it was
            lowered by, the defeat, of their creed. The professor was
            a tall, lank, loose-jointed man, who, while he was talking,
            walked back and forth with a bombastic swing and a rising
            and falling of his index finger, a habit which he had
            probably acquired in the school-room.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the major was considered the argumentative champion
            of Jefferson township, upon him, in the absence of
            the minister, fell the task of defending the Biblical account
            of creation. This task he strove manfully to perform.
            But his efforts were unsuccessful. The professor was well
            versed in those evolutionary theories which have sprung up
            in the last half century, and especially in such authors as
            Spencer and Darwin, who, more than the direct advocates
            of infidelity, have sown the seeds of unbelief. The effect
            of this logic upon Ratke was something like that produced
            upon the Romans by the introduction of Pyrrhus' elephants
            into Italy; but, with the perseverance of that stubborn
            people, he determined to bring confusion to the opposing
            lines by the use of the enemy's own auxiliaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The call to supper gave him an interval of rest and an
            opportunity to collect his scattered forces, just as the blows
            of his opponent were driving him from his last redoubt.
            The major was a firm believer in the benefit of an
            abstemious diet on brain labor. While he appreciated a good
            meal, he liked better a controversial triumph. He ate,
            therefore, very sparingly, keeping his mind on the discussion
            and avoiding such food as is detrimental to clear
            thinking. Of all viands he was fondest of roast pig, and
            near him was a young porker prepared by a master hand,
            but he withdrew his gaze from the tempting brown as he
            reflected that baked pork requires five hours to digest.
        </p>
        <p>
            He noticed to his satisfaction that Largess was eating
            heartily, almost voraciously. The professor had taken
            two dishes of oysters, besides pastry and other eatables,
            when Ratke passed toward him the platter holding the
            pig, which, leaving a liberal share of its contents on his
            plate, made a circuit of the table and returned to its
            original position. Whenever Largess's supply of meat was
            nearly exhausted and his longing glances again wandered
            to the platter for which he was ashamed to call, the
            obliging major, who was nibbling with pretended relish at
            his first piece of bread, politely supplied his wants. And
            now the professor took his third and the last remaining
            piece of pig from the platter, which had been seized and
            passed by Ratke barely in time for it to escape the clutches
            of a ravenous farmer at his right.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major had a suspicion that his conduct in this affair
            was not strictly according to the rules of honorable warfare,
            that it somewhat resembled the ruse of the Central
            African who feeds the hippopotamus pease, or that of the
            sons of Jacob who converted the Hivites to circumcision
            only to slay them before they had recovered from the rite.
            Whatever his scruples, they did not deter him from
            maintaining any advantage which he had gained. Approaching
            Largess, who was picking his teeth and whose lank
            form actually seemed to have grown rotund, he remarked,
            "So you claim that all growth springs primarily from
            intelligence?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Assuredly", replied the professor.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And intelligence is divided into two kinds---conscious
            and unconscious?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is the theory of the leading men of to-day, sir,"
            answered Largess.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And," continued the major, "conscious intelligence
            alone possesses the power of definite thought?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is not a debatable question," dryly commented
            the professor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major congratulated himself that the roast pig was
            taking effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Which requires the higher degree of intelligence," he
            asked---"the creation of the simple or of the complex?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am not partial to trivialities," angrily replied the
            professor. "But, since you wish an answer to every petty
            interrogation which you invent, I will tell you. The
            creation of the complex requires the higher power."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Is there not some conscious intelligence about a
            tree?" inquired the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Conscious intelligence?" said Largess, uncertain
            whether to give a negative or an affirmative answer.
            "Why do you ask?" Then, thinking the major's question
            a declaration and deciding that it was best to oppose it,
            he added, "No enlightened modern scientist ever saw fit
            to ascribe conscious intelligence to a tree. It is contrary
            to recognized evolutionary theories."
        </p>
        <p>
            "And time is a period of constant progress?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No man of sense ever had the hardihood to dispute
            it," answered Largess.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now," said the major, "one question more is all I
            will ask. What kind of intelligence shaped that top,
            which Mr. Osborne's boy has probably had for his amusement?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "If this is your last," said the professor, "I will have
            patience to answer you. It was conscious intelligence."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Allow me to state several of your propositions," said
            the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition I.: Conscious intelligence alone possesses
            the power of definite thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition II.: Time is a period of constant progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition III.: The creation of the complex requires
            a higher degree of intelligence than the creation of the
            simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition IV.: A tree is not created by conscious
            intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Proposition V.: A top is created by conscious intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do I state your position correctly?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "We will go back to protoplasm," said Largess. "The
            cause of primordial growth is intelligence."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You wish to ignore my question," returned Ratke.
            "I have correctly stated your argument. A top requires
            for its construction one kind of wood, a knife and a boy
            with little mechanical skill. A tree is composed of many
            different elements which I cannot mention. The tree,
            therefore, is more complex and requires a higher order of
            intelligence. It is not possible for all of your statements
            to be correct. You assert, firstly, that the creation of the
            complex requires a higher degree of intelligence than the
            creation of the simple. And secondly, that the creation
            of the complex requires the lower order of intelligence.
            Which one of your propositions is wrong?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir," said the professor, walking back and forth and
            resuming the bombastic swing and the rising and falling
            of his index finger, "when you confine yourself to reason,
            I will answer you. You have no authority from science
            to ascribe conscious intelligence to a tree. Time is a
            period of progress. When that tree falls, decays and its
            substance is in the body of a man, then there will be
            associated with it that intangible thing which is called
            mind."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If intelligence is the sole creator," replied Ratke,
            "and all growth is self-creating, when you were an oak
            you might well be proud of your intellect. Then you
            could measure out the exact quantity of each ingredient
            necessary to your development, and, at the same time,
            tell each rootlet what kind of nutriment it should con-
            tribute to the general supply. Had you in weighing let the
            balance slip a notch, you would have made an elm instead
            of an oak. Then you had knowledge and ingenuity such
            as is possessed by no human chemist or inventor. Now,
        </p>
        <p>
            I doubt if you have ingenuity enough to make a good
            ferule. And yet you say time is a period of constant
            progress. Professor Largess, you are indebted for your
            entanglement not to me, but to yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Bertrand," said Mrs. Sparks, "come away. I wouldn't
            pay any attention to him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will talk no longer with one so unreasonable,"
            declared the professor, going toward the bedroom, which
            had been made a receptacle of hats and overcoats.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Largess," began Ratke, following him until the bedroom
            door was closed against him, "which one of your
            propositions did I mistake? Tell me. Does the creation
            of the complex require a higher order of intelligence than
            the creation of the simple? Is time a period of constant
            progress?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "My batteries were too strong for him," commented the
            major as he was on his way home. "I completely
            demoralized him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Didn't you tell him he beat himself?" asked Mrs.
            Grippin. "And now you're claiming you was the one
            that did it."
        </p>
        <p>
            While they were going along a level stretch of road,
            they were passed by Lyman Sparks, Mrs. Sparks and
            Professor Largess in a buggy drawn by Sparks' trotter,
            Madge T.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Charge!" shouted Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            The horses instantly sprang into a run. Mrs. Grippin
            was saved from falling only by clinging to her brother, and
            John and Nora were thrown in a heap to the bottom of
            the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            "James Ratke," shrieked Mrs. Grippin, "you don't
            deserve to have any horses. You stop now, for I won't
            ride so. You act like a fool."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Go on. Uncle James," cried Nora gleefully from the
            bottom of the box. "Don't you let him beat you, Uncle
            James. Oh my! Ain't it fun! We're gaining on him,"
        </p>
        <p>
            The major ran his team by Sparks, and, wishing to
            show that one of his horses excelled in another gait,
            steadied Taylor to a trot, allowing the gray Bill to lope
            along by his side. The change in tactics cost him his
            success in the race, for Sparks, urging Madge T. to the
            utmost, again went by him and obtained the lead on a
            narrow causeway where he could not be passed and racing
            was impossible. After turning the corner west of the
            church, the major practiced his team in making a quick
            start and in obeying instantly the summons of "Halt!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "James Ratke," said Mrs. Grippin, when she stood
            by their dwelling, "you act crazy. I never saw such a
            man. I've a good notion to say I never will ride with you
            again."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I wish," said the major reflectively, "that I had
            brought with us the cow I bought of Osborne. I might
            have hitched her behind the wagon."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," retorted Mrs. Grippin contemptuously; "then
            you'd have dragged her home. Tie a cow behind a wagon
            when you drive."

            CHAPTER VII.<br>
            <small>MONTCALM TAKES A NIGHT'S RAMBLE.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            The spring was advanced to May. A few changes had
            taken place at the farm. The major had prosecuted with
            more than his usual vigor his various enterprises. He had
            improved his Jerusalem wagon. He had exercised a better
            supervision over his hired men. He had succeeded in
            reducing the hill almost to a level with the quagmire, a
            task which, owing to his under-estimation of the number
            of grammes of force required for the transfer, or to his
            overestimation of the number of ergs of work in his men, had
            taken longer than he had expected. Wingscheut, dissatisfied
            with the shoveling which he had been obliged to do,
            had hired out to Lyman Sparks, where he had found
            smaller wages and harder work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The large clock in the sitting-room had struck eleven,
            and the Ratke family and farm hands, with one exception,
            had gone to bed. Montcalm, thoughtful and gloomy, sat
            in his bedroom. The last month had not been one of
            satisfaction to him. He had been accustomed to have
            his attentions sought after instead of seeking for an
            opportunity to bestow them. Some social triumphs, it is
            true, had been his; but Manie, whom of all women he
            most admired, had declined to accept his addresses, and
            had even hinted that his compliments savored more of
            flattery than of sincerity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Irresolutely the restless hired man rose and peered from
            his window. The evergreens, almost touching;; the house,
            were moving slightly their branches and emitting a
            subdued murmur which was scarcely audible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Casting off his indecision, Montcalm began to unlock
            one of two trunks which were in the room. The trunk
            was well fastened, requiring him to press several springs
            and to turn a thin key before the lid flew open and its
            contents were revealed. Had the major glanced over
            Montcalm's shoulder at that moment, he would have been
            struck with astonishment; but he could not possibly have
            named any considerable proportion of the articles which
            he would have seen. There were small saws, iron or steel
            implements, and, most curious of all, four large woolen
            pads, to which were attached hollow columns of leather
            resembling bootlegs, and each of which, when placed upon
            the floor, covered an area of more than one square foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Picking up the pads and a long steel bar and putting
            them into a large sack, Montcalm opened the window and
            climbed stealthily to the ground. From the shelter of the
            trees he scrutinized the road, which showed no sign of
            being traversed. The moon had set, but the stars,
            unobscured save by a few thin streaks of cloud, in a
            measure made up for the missing light. Passing to the barn
            from the lower edge of the shaded walk, he continued his way
            at a distance from the road sufficient to escape the
            observation of a possible passer-by and was soon in the
            rear of the tenement house occupied by Philetus Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            His approach was heralded by a suppressed growl, and
            Takum's yellow dog, Lina, and two litters of pups, one
            about the size of large cats, the other larger than their
            mother, came out to give him a canine welcome. The
            elder dog with the younger progeny trotted back to the
            nest under the house, but the larger pups capered about
            him as if desirous to become acquainted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The place had about it an air of thriftlessness, quite
            suggestive of the character of its inhabitants. The fence
            which had bounded the yard had yielded to the demand
            for fuel, and in the place where a wood-pile had once been
            there were left not chips enough to kindle a fire. A light
            streamed through a window, from which had been broken
            several panes of glass, whose places had been supplied by
            a board, some rags and two old hats.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the house, a female voice was charging Takum with
            a neglect to provide wood, and from the loft came boyish
            complaints, which were indistinguishable to Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Harv," growled Takum, "you quit your crowdin', or
            I'll be up there d'rectly."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, going to the rear of some bushes, whither
            he was followed by the pups, lifted one of them by the
            tail clear from the ground, an act which elicited a
            doleful lament, and brought the mother snarling to the
            assistance of her offspring.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Shut up, you brutes," yelled Takum, poking his head
            from the door. "What in thunder is the matter with
            'em ?" he ejaculated, as the noise continued unabated.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why! Mr. Montcalm," he exclaimed, as he suddenly
            confronted the visitor. "I didn't know you was here. I
            thought somethin' was the matter with the pups by the
            way Lina took on."
        </p>
        <p>
            "And so there was," replied Montcalm. "This one
            was clever enough to call you out for me. Get your hat
            and come on. Get one you are not used to wearing."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ain't it purty light?" asked Philetus. "Seems to me
            it is."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Very well," returned Montcalm, "if you are afraid, I
            can get some one else."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, no, I ain't afraid,' assured Takum. "But I
            thought, you know. I'll git my hat right off."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Get one of those from the window," said Montcalm.
            "Do not let your wife know that any one is with you."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm and Takum traversed the field in front of
            Ratke's at an angle sufficient to bring them some distance
            in the rear of the leveled hill. As, after crossing several
            other fields, they clambered over a fence which bounded
            a strip of timber, some sheep fled through the bushes in
            alarm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Jerusalem!" said Takum. "Wouldn't this be a fine
            place for a feller to help himself to mutton? I thought
            they was runnin' over by the church. They was last
            week. Green keeps his sheep fat, too. But they ain't so
            fat as Lyme Sparkses. His sheep is just a wad o' fat.
            But of all sheep ole Ratke's. Gosh all Friday ! I wouldn't
            eat one o' his sheep for a farm. But say, if you like
            chickens, Lyme 'Sparks has got some o' the biggest, fattest
            Cochins you ever see. They grow quick, you know.
            Why, the meat 'ill almost sqush in your hands."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am not hungry for chickens," Montcalm shortly
            replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Mebbe you like ducks better," suggested Philetus.
            "Green has got some o' the genuine Pekin. We might
            as well kill two birds with one stone."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have no appetite for ducks," answered Montcalm.
            "Let us attend to the business in hand."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I s'pose nothin'll satisfy you but a goose," said
            Takum. "Widder Smith is the only one in this hull
            country that keeps geese. They're the plaguiest things to
            hook, though, you ever see. They'll get right on the
            doorstep an' gabble, gabble enough to wake the nations.
            But they ain't none on 'em sharp enough for me. Just you
            watch, an' I'll show you a trick that'll make you open
            your eyes."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Is your name Phleet?" inquired Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's the handle I go by," answered Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, then, Phleet, you have altogether too much
            mouth for a man of your size. Do what I tell you to do,
            and never mind hens and geese."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is that?" he exclaimed, as some animals came
            cautiously in view at the edge of an open space. "They
            are your dogs."
        </p>
        <p>
            The older pups, which, alone, had ventured to follow,
            were by a few clubs sent yelping back to the residence of
            Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nice help the boss picked out for me," commented
            Montcalm---"a fool and his dogs."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm a-goin' back," said Philetus, "I ain't a-goin' to
            stay here to be abused."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You can go a little ways, if you like," answered Montcalm,
            "about a step. At the second I shall shoot you."
        </p>
        <p>
            Philetus was terrified as much by the kindly tone of
            Montcalm as by the savage words with which it was
            coupled. So dreadful a threat, uttered in such a manner,
            he believed was not an idle one. He followed in silence
            his superior, whom he watched with wonder and fear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emerging from the woods, they came to a lane which
            led to the barns of Green.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are working in finely, Phleet," complimented
            Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm glad you think so, Mr. Montcalm," responded
            Philetus in the lowest of whispers, as much pleased at
            the compliment as was one of his dogs at his own fondling.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Lie here by this straw-stack," commanded Montcalm,
            as they entered the barn-yard. "I will take a turn about,
            the house. Can you tell me where all the folks sleep ? "
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ole Green and Mis' Green they sleep in the bedroom
            this way," answered Philetus, so cautiously that he could
            be barely heard. "An' the fool, he sleeps upstairs. An'
            say, don't git mad if I talk too much, but mebbe ole Green
            ain't gone to bed. He don't always burn lights, just to
            save oil, you know."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am glad you spoke of that," said Montcalm, taking
            the opportunity to soothe Takum's wounded feelings. "I
            will be careful."
        </p>
        <p>
            Philetus, whose nerves had not recovered from the
            shock which they had received in the woods, was content
            to lie hidden in the straw. He started nervously, as he
            heard the whisper of Montcalm, who approached from a
            direction opposite to that in which he had set out.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Everything is all right. Bring on that sack," said
            Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Green, following the custom which prevailed among
            Jackson County farmers, kept his horse-barn locked.
            Montcalm drew the steel bar from the sack, inserted
            it in the staple, and at a few hearty wrenches twisted the
            fastening from its place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Takum's curiosity concerning the sack, for the
            satisfaction of which he had not dared ask a question, had
            now an opportunity to be gratified. Montcalm took one
            of the strange-looking articles and endeavored to put the
            boot-like attachment on the leg of a colt which stood in a
            farther stall; but the animal was high-spirited, and he
            was obliged to summon Takum to his assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The efforts of both were required to encase the feet of
            the colt in the pads. Considerable noise was made by
            the beast, as he stepped about trying to keep his feet
            from the clumsy coverings by which they were being
            cumbered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm ordered Takum to stay close to the corn-
            crib, which was between the barns and the house, while he
            made a second tour about the latter building.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Everything is quiet," he remarked, as he returned to
            his waiting ally. "Both of us must get that horse by the
            bridle, one on each side, for he promises to give us some
            trouble."
        </p>
        <p>
            It was as Montcalm had predicted. The animal, when
            he comprehended that the bulky articles were on his feet,
            shied from side to side and came very near jamming
            Montcalm against the corner of a post. But the pads,
            soft as boxing-gloves, so muffled the sound that it could
            be heard but a few rods; and when the horse trod the
            solid ground, his uneasiness abated.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You may ride if you like," said Montcalm, when they
            were in the lane.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I'd rather foot it," answered Philetus, suspecting
            that the colt would not prove a docile beast of burden.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a leap Montcalm lighted on the back of the
            horse, which plunged furiously forward, but subsided to a
            slower gait when he felt the grip of the master on his
            rein. Philetus, afraid to lag behind, raced after his
            superior at a pace which severely taxed his powers and
            led him to the conclusion that hereafter, should he be
            given the choice, he would hazard a possible fall rather
            than accept the alternative of certain exertions which
            were more violent than pleasant. At the entrance to the
            woods Montcalm dismounted and opened the gate before
            he was joined by his breathless subordinate. He led the
            colt through the timber, as the trees and overhanging
            limbs might lead to a casualty should he remain on the
            animal's back.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Say," whispered Philetus, "don't think I'm a-talkin'
            too much, but Green calls this colt Billy."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am glad you told me," replied the leader. "It may
            help me to manage him."
        </p>
        <p>
            The direction which they were pursuing was southeasterly.
            Philetus was astonished to see Montcalm, a
            stranger in the neighborhood, lead the way through the
            woods with a facility which he, a practiced raider of the
            vicinity, could not have equaled. Nor did his surprise
            abate when his companion, tying his horse to a sapling,
            brought from beneath a rotten log a sack, concerning the
            contents of which he was too much intimidated to inquire,
            but which he believed to contain a set of large woolen
            pads.
        </p>
        <p>
            They were obliged to let down a fence in order to pass
            from the woods. After the rails were put back to their
            places, Montcalm told Philetus that he might ride; and
            that worthy, remembering the strain to which his legs
            were subjected in the lane, gladly accepted his offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Philetus had not far to practice his equestrianism. He
            passed through a gate, which led into the road and which
            Montcalm opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            The large square house of Lyman Sparks, visible in the
            starlight, stood behind its partial screen of small
            pine-trees. It was evident from the buildings that the
            farm was owned by one whose success had been obtained by
            mastering the details of his profession. Not a stray board
            could be seen about the premises. Not a picket was
            loose in the fence which enclosed the house. The barns
            were models of comfort to the stock and convenience to
            the farmer; and between them was a straw-stack
            symmetrically built and having a neatly rounded top.
        </p>
        <p>
            In front of the barnyard were some walnut-trees, and to
            a limb which hung conveniently low Montcalm tied the
            halter-strap of the stolen horse.
        </p>
        <p>
            "In which barn is Madge T.?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "In the one this way, the first stall," answered Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Stand by that small building," said Montcalm, "and
            watch the horse. If you hear any disturbance, notify me
            at once."
        </p>
        <p>
            Philetus was by the protection of a not unfamiliar
            retreat, for it was the hen-house which he had so often
            visited. His instinct of thieving --- for the propensity
            had become an instinct --- was stronger than his fear of
            Montcalm, especially in the absence of the latter. In a
            very short time he had one of Sparks' matchless Cochins
            stuffed inside his jacket. His intrusion aroused a cackling
            protest among the fowls, and the dog, which had hitherto
            kept quiet, now ran out and added to the tumult. Philetus,
            alarmed at the result of his action, went hastily to
            Montcalm, and whispered,
        </p>
        <p>
            "That dog's out, and they can't nobody stop him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The pads are all on," said Montcalm. "Help me lead
            out this horse, and we will get away immediately."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Quick, Mr. Montcalm!" said Takum in excitement.
            "They're a-comin'! They're a comin'! "
        </p>
        <p>
            Just then Sparks, clad in his under-garments, shouted
            from his back porch,
        </p>
        <p>
            "Halt! Where be you a-goin' with my horse?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Jump on her back," ordered Montcalm. "Ride east
            a quarter of a mile and wait. I will join you as soon as I
            can."
        </p>
        <p>
            There was near the barn from which Madge T. had
            been taken a third party, whose proximity was not
            suspected, either by Sparks or by the depredators. The
            vender of "Great American Panacea" repulsed at every
            house where he had asked for a night's lodging, had
            sought the straw-stack, in the side of which a hole had
            been eaten by the stock. The barking of the dog and the
            disturbance in the hen-house and in the stable suggested
            that he was not the only intruder, and the voice of Sparks
            confirmed the indications from other sources. With the
            conviction that the location was becoming dangerous, the
            peddler picked up his satchels and prepared to depart.
            He emerged from the cavern in the side of the straw-stack
            at the same moment that Wingscheut, who had dilatorily
            followed Sparks and his boy, came around the corner of
            the hen-house and confronted him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once face to face with the supposed horse-thief, the
            German was far from feeling the courage of which he was
            wont to boast. His employer and son were on the opposite
            side of the barn, and before their arrival to his
            assistance, he might be killed by the desperate stranger.
            His conduct was determined by the indecision of Panicky.
            His valor returned with tenfold intensity as the peddler
            whirled, dropped his satchels and made toward the barnyard
            fence, and with a wild dash he caught him with his
            boasted hiplock and brought him heavily to the ground,
            yelling at the top of his voice,
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'fe cot te tam horse-tief ! I'fe cot te tam horse-tief!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Poor Panicky clutched the wrists of Wingscheut, whose
            intention was mercilessly to pound him. He would have
            given the contents of his satchels, of his pockets, even the
            clothes he wore, to be placed, unhampered, four feet from
            his captor.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, let me up!" he pleaded, clinging to the writhing
            hands, which threatened to descend upon him with crushing
            force. "I haven't stole any horse."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes you haf stole a horse," affirmed Wingscheut,
            struggling to free his hands, "te pest horse in te whole
            country. I'll cif you a face vat von't look coot in
            Suntay-school. Let co my hant, I tell you. Can't you mint
            notting? Come kill te tam horse-tief," he added, as Sparks
            and his boy drew near.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm did not wait to see his order to Takum
            obeyed. He ran down the graveled drive and to the
            walnut-tree before he was passed by Philetus. He had
            hitched the horse underneath the tree, the limbs of which
            were low, so that he could distinctly see neither the house
            nor the barn. An embarrassing difficulty was now presented.
            The halter-strap, at which the colt had been
            continually pulling, could not be readily untied; and he
            had left his knife at home in a pocket of his working
            clothes. Pulling and twisting, he managed to break the
            limb and disengage the severed extremity from the
            halter-strap.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was at this juncture that he heard Wingscheut
            proclaiming that he had captured the horse-thief. He was
            at a loss to account for the circumstance. Madge T. had
            certainly raced by him, but behind the low-hanging bushes
            he had not ascertained whether Philetus were on her back,
            although he had had no suspicion that such was not the
            case. He laid hold of a strong stick which had been used
            to knock walnuts from the tree, before he decided on his
            course of action, but all doubts as to the cause of the
            outcry were at an end when Wingscheut again called Sparks
            to come and kill the horse-thief.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever were the faults of Montcalm, he was not the
            one to desert an ally. Assuring himself that his revolver
            was ready for use, he sprang upon the back of the horse
            and dashed up the drive, through a gate which had been
            left open by Sparks, and around the corner of the barn.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sparkses, happening to look up in season, fled
            before what they supposed to be a rescue of cavalry,
            effecting their retreat through a second gate which led
            into the lane. Wingscheut, intent on pounding Panicky
            and unwarned by the muffled hoofs of the horse, which
            made but little noise, did not realize his danger until
            communication with the house and with his employer
            was cut off. He was frightened at the prospect of
            receiving the violence which he was anxious to mete out
            to another, and he limped around the straw-stack with a
            speed which was, for a man who had a crippled leg, almost
            phenomenal. His terror did not find vent in words until
            Montcalm raced up and struck him several blows with his
            cudgel, when he exclaimed:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ton't kill a man vat ain't to plame! Warum schlägst
            du mich? Was hab' ich gethan? I ain't tone notting!
            Te teffil, I ain't tone notting!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, satisfied that those whom he had dispersed
            would not soon organize for pursuit, turned his horse by
            a considerable effort and rode back to Panicky, who,
            satchels in hand, was preparing to leave the locality, which
            had for him no pleasant recollections. "Here," said
            Montcalm, unable distinctly to see the man whom he had
            rescued, and supposing him to be Philetus, "jump on
            quick and ride away."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't believe I care to ride," answered Panicky.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What!" ejaculated Montcalm. "Who are you ?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The marauder leaped on his horse, from which he had
            dismounted, and was instantly flying down the drive. His
            perplexity over the incident at the straw-stack did not
            abate when he found Takum waiting at the appointed
            place.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh! Mr. Montcalm," whispered Philetus, "I was
            afraid they'd caught you. I heard 'em sayin' they'd got
            the horse-thief and they was a-goin' to kill 'im. This ain't
            hookin' chickens. We better be gittin' right out o' here."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There is no hurry," replied Montcalm. "They are
            no more anxious to find us than we are to find them.
            Drive your horse out to the side of the road, and we will
            trot along. Did you see any one around the barn or
            straw-stack?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Nary a body," said Takum. "Can't you touch up
            your horse, Mr. Montcalm? Caesar! how this mare pulls.
            I can't hold her. 'Twouldn't do for us to git far apart.
            They'd git away with us sure."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will try to keep so close to you that you can protect
            me," Montcalm answered.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's just what I'll do," said Takum. "I'll stick
            closer'n a brother. Less see if there's any run in these
            horses."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We will stop here," said Montcalm, as they came to a
            wood at the end of the road. "Let down the fence. Be
            careful," he cautioned, as Takum threw the rails right
            and left.
        </p>
        <p>
            "They're a-gittin' the neighbors out!" whispered
            Philetus. "That's Sparkses boy. Just hear him yell!
            Less light out!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "They will not be here under half an hour," said Montcalm
            "We must put up this fence or they will track us."
        </p>
        <p>
            The wood was here easy of access. It had been used as
            a picnic ground and had been consequently cleared of
            underbrush. "Most of the trees were white oaks, the limbs
            of which, unadorned, save by newly sprouted leaves,
            admitted the direct rays of the stars and the diffused
            light of the rising moon, though that luminary was not yet
            visible above the tree tops. Farther along the slope which
            the plunderers and their booty were descending, the trees
            were taller, closer together and covered with a more
            luxuriant growth of leaves. The boundary between the
            forest and the great swamp was formed by a strip of small
            ash and poplars, through which led, here and there, a
            path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ordering Takum to hold the horses, Montcalm went
            into the bushes and soon reappeared with two pairs of
            high rubber boots.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello," exclaimed Takum, who was beginning to lose
            his apprehension of pursuit, "how did you know them
            boots was there?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is no bad thing to be good at guessing," said
            Montcalm. "Strip off your cowhides and put on a pair,
            for you will need them. After we get through this
            thicket, we will ride till we come to the high bushes."
        </p>
        <p>
            They rode easily through low brush and the belt of
            water, which at the edge reached nearly to the horses'
            bodies, but which grew shallow as they proceeded. When
            they came to the high bushes, however, the brutes refused
            to proceed farther. Montcalm tied the colt, removed the
            pads from the feet of the animals, and led Madge T.,
            while Philetus was ordered to urge her from the rear.
            Sparks' trotter never before experienced such a
            castigation as was administered to her by the tamarack
            pole in the hands of the obedient Takum. Although
            the distance was not more than half a mile, and Philetus
            in wielding the pole spared neither the brute nor his own
            muscle, it was thirty minutes before they reached the
            tamaracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well," remarked Takum, wiping the sweat from his
            brow, "we can't git no horse through them tamaracks."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let me show you how these trees grow," said Montcalm,
            pulling one of them from the ground, in which a sharpened
            point had been sticking.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I swan!" ejaculated the wondering Philetus, "somebody
            has cut them poles and stuck 'em back in again."
        </p>
        <p>
            Madge T. was again tied, and the two men commenced
            to pull the trees from a narrow space which had been
            prepared for the speedy completion of a road. Many
            fallen and nearly decayed tamaracks, which had been left
            to give the way a natural appearance, were by Montcalm's
            command lifted aside carefully, that they might again be
            returned, unchanged, to their former position. It was
            necessary to be near the trees which had been cut and
            set in the ground to distinguished them from those which
            were standing as they had grown. But a careful observer
            would have noticed that the ground was disturbed, that
            many of the trees were leaning, and that his feet often
            stepped on the small stumps, which were imperfectly
            hidden by ruffled moss. Montcalm depended for the
            security of the stolen property on the loneliness of the
            place more than on the measures he had taken to provide
            for the closing of the road when his booty should have
            passed through. Nor was this confidence ill-founded.
            The huckleberries and tamaracks were so thick that in
            many places it was impossible to see at a distance of more
            than six feet. The mat of bushes, catching at clothes and
            striking when they were bent back and released, were
            certain to occupy a liberal share of the attention of
            possible wanderer, if, as was quite unlikely, he might be
            led at that season of the year, by business or curiosity,
            to flounder through the mire and water which surrounded the
            swamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they proceeded into the interior of the thicket, the
            trees were larger and farther apart, so that few of them had
            to be removed. The road here became more winding,
            not only because those who cleared it found it easier to
            pass around than to chop down a large trunk, but because
            this method offered less danger of detection. Presently
            the way became straighter and the trees smaller and more
            numerous, as at the edge of the tamaracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a cleared spot of a few yards in area the plunderers
            halted. Ample provision had been made for the
            accommodation of the horses. By the border of the clearing
            were a bag of oats, some bedding and a large bundle of hay
            wound about with a rope. Had Philetus possessed the
            spirit of romanticism, he would have reveled in the scene
            before him. But unappreciated, even unnoticed, was that
            combination of picturesqueness formed by the rising moon,
            the spoils of the foray, the steed which had been ridden
            in the expedition, the dark, resolute face of the leader and
            the wall of marshy forest which screened him in his
            retreat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ground, which in most swamps is highest at the
            center, was here quite dry. It was covered by moss, on
            which was spread a finer carpeting -- the leaves which had
            dropped the preceding fall; and over it arched the
            tamaracks, which had put forth their peculiar pointed
            foliage before the phlegmatic oaks of the upland had
            covered their naked branches after the lethargy of winter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second horse was more difficult to lead than the
            first. He pulled back on his halter and when urged by
            the blows with which Takum belabored him, plunged
            ahead with such vehemence that Montcalm was scarcely
            able to hold him. It was a relief to Philetus when both
            horses were eating together in the opening. The work of
            replacing the sharpened stakes occupied some minutes.
            Montcalm insisted that the old brush and fallen poles
            should be dragged back to their places and arranged with
            care.
        </p>
        <p>
            More disagreeable than the task which they had completed
            was that of wading through the water which skirted
            the marsh. The rubber boots, high as they were, sank
            beneath the surface, and the clothing of the lower limbs
            was saturated with muddy water. In the border of the
            woods the men changed their rubber for leather boots,
            and Montcalm substituted for his drenched trousers a pair
            which he found in a clump of bushes, and which had been
            left evidently with a view to meeting that exigency.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ain't it about time we was makin' towards home, Mr.
            Montcalm?" asked Philetus.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why, are you sick of foraging?" inquired Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I ain't sick of it, as you might say," answered
            Takum, "but I've got enough of it for just now, you know.
            My legs is about petered."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think you and I can do a very good business," said
            Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's about what I think," returned Takum. "Me
            an' you is hustlers, an' they hadn't nobody better interfere
            with us neither."
        </p>
        <p>
            As Takum finished this speech, his foot caught in a
            brush, and he was thrown against a tree with such force
            that his jacket was unbuttoned and the dead hen tumbled
            against a log with a thud.
        </p>
        <p>
            "How did you come by that?" demanded Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, you see," answered the terrified Philetus, "I
            was right there, you know, by the hen-house, you know,
            an' I thought it wouldn't do any hurt, seein' I'knew the
            way in, to git this chicken."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Was that when the dog barked?" asked Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, just afore," acknowledged Takum. "You ain't
            mad, be you, Mr. Montcalm?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I would not try any such thing again," said Montcalm.
            "You must attend to business and let hens, ducks and
            geese alone. You are green at the work, but by training
            you will make a good hand."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You bet your sweet neck," replied Philetus. "I ain't
            no two-spot. Say, don't you think me an' you could git
            them horses without accountin' to nobody for 'em?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, it would not be best," said Montcalm. "We
            could not sell them without getting caught. Besides, there
            is a great risk in taking them. I never work in a
            neighborhood long after I start a gang. You and I have too
            long heads to wallow through swamps and risk our necks
            around other men's barns at night. We will do the
            planning, and let some one else do the work."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Say, but there is somethin' in that," acquiesced
            Philetus. "Me an' you can do the plannin'. I was to git
            ten dollars for what I done, an' I've been scart more'n
            ten dollars' worth, take it all around. Don't none o' the
            men you have to work for you ever tell?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, yes!" answered Montcalm, "they sometimes do."
        </p>
        <p>
            "An' do you ever hurt 'em?" queried Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," replied Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "So you never do nothin' to 'em?" said Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, yes!" said Montcalm, "we do something to them."
        </p>
        <p>
            "An' what do you do?" asked Philetus.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Shoot them," answered Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I thought you said you never hurt 'em," said Takum
            in a disappointed tone.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Neither do we. We kill them so quick it does not
            hurt them," gently replied Montcalm,
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, I wouldn't tell nobody," said Takum earnestly.
            "I've hooked more chickens'n anybody in this hull
            country, an' I never told anybody but you.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Takum's house Montcalm struck across the fields
            and was soon by Ratke's barns. In the shadow of the
            largest he paused and deliberated whether it were not
            better to leave the neighborhood. He knew that pursuit
            must have been organized for his capture. It was also
            possible that he had been recognized by Wingscheut,
            Sparks or the mysterious stranger whom he had rescued.
            Moreover, he had reason to fear the instability of
            Philetus. But Philetus might prove a better confidant than
            helper, especially after being impressed with the certainty
            of punishment for the first breach of confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm decided to remain. He hesitated to leave
            her for whose approval, though it could not be gained, no
            sacrifice would have been too great. He told himself
            that, had she given him the least encouragement, he would
            have averted the misfortunes which were gathering about
            her and her relatives. He was tired of the life he was
            leading, with its trickery and deceit, its wronging of honest
            men. He would lay his plans, and at a few successful
            moves gather in the money which would enable him to
            live at peace with all mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strangely he felt the force of those words which that
            Sabbath night Manie had spoken to him concerning
            Ahab and the Syrian. He had made the covenant with
            Ben-hadad, but his Ramoth Gilead had not yet come.
            And would it come? With that apprehension by which
            the guilty spirit alone is haunted, he looked about him.
            In the peaceful air, undisturbed by a sound harsher than
            the note of the whip-poor-will, was no warning. The only
            foreign element in the quiet which reigned about the
            place was the turbulence which agitated the mind of one
            man.
        </p>
        <p>
            The night was now well advanced. Some stars which
            had by the marauders been used as landmarks or timepieces,
            had changed their places or disappeared. The Pleiades
            had descended to the westward. The great dipper had
            lowered its handle until it appeared to be a receptacle
            toward which were falling myriads of glittering drops.
            Taking his way through the spruce, Montcalm raised his
            window and clambered in.

            CHAPTER VIII.<br>
            <small>PURSUING THE DEPREDATORS.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Toward morning the major was awakened by loud and
            repealed shouting. As passers-by had sometimes amused
            themselves by calling him up and cracking jokes at his
            expense, he did not at first respond to the summons. But
            the continuance of the shouting argued the occurrence of
            something unusual, and, hastily dressing, he went to the
            dining-room window.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the road was a band of mounted men, the advance
            of which only could be seen by Ratke, while the main
            portion of the body was obscured by the evergreens.
            Some of the troop carried guns, several bore pitchforks,
            not more than one or two appeared unarmed, and these
            probably had revolvers.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is the matter?" inquired the major.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Matter enough!" returned a voice. "Two horses was
            stole last night, and we're after the thieves."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We've got some inquiries to make here," said Green,
            riding through the large gate and within a short distance
            of the house, where he was followed by the band. "You
            have men from every part of the country, and nobody
            knows whether they are honest or not. What we want to
            know is, where are they?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "You may search the premises if you like," said Ratke.
            "All of my men are in the club-house. All but one," he
            added, "and he is above suspicion. I will call him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Trace, Trace," called the major, going to the door of
            Montcalm's room with a lamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Come in," said Montcalm, "I thought I heard some
            one calling."
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as Ratke had left him, Montcalm sprang up,
            scaped together some patches of swamp muck which
            bad not been noticed by his unobservant employer, and,
            wrapping them in a paper, threw them hastily into one of
            his trunks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stepping out of doors, be saw the thief-hunters, who
            were returning from the club-house.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hurrah, boys!" called a young fellow in a white hat;
            "everybody get on a horse."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is the use of making such a racket?" asked
            Green. "You let the thieves know you are coming long
            before we get to them."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am my own boss," answered the fellow in the white
            hat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm ran to the horse-barn, unlocked it with the
            key which he had obtained from Ratke, bridled the steeds
            and led them out before he was rejoined by his employer.
            After assisting the major to get on the back of Bill, he
            too mounted, and they at once sped eastward toward the
            party, which they presently overtook.
        </p>
        <p>
            The band halted in front of Takum's.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We want to see where Phleet is," said Green.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shout after shout was given, but Philetus did not respond.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There is no use in disturbing him," said the major.
            "He has not enterprise enough for a horse-thief."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't be too sure," said Green, proceeding to the front
            door and administering several loud taps.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Who's there?" asked a female voice after the lapse
            of a few seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Where is Phleet?" inquired Green, ignoring her
            question.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He ain't to home," replied Mrs. Takum. "He's
            gone to his uncle's."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There, Ratke," exclaimed Green triumphantly as he
            neared the road." He's gone, and right in the middle of
            the night. We'll take a look after him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is probable that he is where he hadn't ought to be,"
            said a red-whiskered man whose name was Holmes. "I
            shouldn't wonder at all if he's with the horses now."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, realizing that it would be dangerous to allow
            suspicion to fall upon his subordinate, jumped to the
            ground and inquired, "What is his name?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Phleet," answered Sparks,
        </p>
        <p>
            Rushing to the door of the house and giving it some
            kicks which threatened to tear it from its hinges,
            Montcalm shouted,
        </p>
        <p>
            "Phleet, Phleet, if you don't come, we will kick down
            your door and drag you out of bed."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, I'm a-coming' answered the trembling Philetus.
            "Don't be a-gittin' mad now."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There," said the major, triumphing in his turn, "he
            was afraid to answer. He thought you were about to do
            him violence."
        </p>
        <p>
            The band, unanimously agreeing not to disturb Takum
            further, continued their course, which they decided to
            direct through the swamp, instead of along the road which
            branched southward.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Where have you been hunting?" asked Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We've been all along the road by Lyme's," answered
            Holmes." We turned the corner east of his house and
            went up by Rob Eliot's, and so around to Oakville and
            your house. But we have found no trace of the thieves."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The funniest thing of the whole bisness is that they
            didn't leave no tracks," remarked Sparks." There was
            a ways that the ground was all scraped up, places two or
            three feet across. But it didn't go far, an' then we couldn't
            find hide nor hair."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In my opinion," said Holmes, "we had better stop at
            the house of every suspicious character. If we find them
            at home, very good. If not, we will suspect them. I
            think the men that took those horses are with them now.
            When I was a boy I had some traps stolen. There was
            a very light snow, and I started to follow the tracks of the
            thieves. I happened to meet an old trapper, and he said,
            'I'll go with you, but we won't follow these tracks.
            There's no telling where they go to. We'll take the back
            track.' So we followed the tracks back. They led to a
            house not more than half a mile from the trapping ground.
            They were two surprised boys, when I caught them walking
            into the house with my traps."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Had we not better divide our party?" asked Ratke.
            "Concentration of power is necessary when we wish to
            apply a prodigious force at a particular point. But in this
            case, where the resistance is apt to be small, we had better
            get at the short end of the lever, thus providing for much
            agility and extension of movement."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I can't make out how we can get around any livelier
            by dividin' up," said Sparks. "I can move just as fast
            when I'm with somebody as when I'm alone."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am not to blame," returned Ratke, "because you
            cannot see why we can look over more ground by dividing
            our force, why we can stand a better chance to catch
            the thieves by watching a mile than a rod of territory. I
            suppose that they would not dare make any resistance if
            we found them."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There's just where you're mistaken," replied Sparks.
            "They come a-chargin' up my lane to beat all, an' they drove
            me an' my boy to the house, in spite o' all we could do."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," said Wingscheut, "tey come a-charchin' up.
            Put, provitin' I hat hat a coot man vith me, I coot a kilt
            efery tam horse-tief."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How many of them were there?" inquired Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Vell," answered Wingscheut," tere vass two in te first
            place. Unt von of 'em he run. Unt, provitin' my short

        </p>
        <p>
            "Who was he, Wingscheut?" asked the fellow in the
            white hat.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Vell," answered Wingscheut, "maype you ton't pelief
            it, put he vass Panicky,"
        </p>
        <p>
            The German's statement was greeted with a laugh of
            derision which silenced him for some minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That was a fine animal you lost, Sparks," remarked
            Ratke.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," said Sparks, "she was the best blooded animal
            in the county."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are mistaken," replied the major. "My Taylor
            has better blood than Madge T."
        </p>
        <p>
            "They don't nobody else think so," returned Sparks.
            "Madge T. is by Wellington, an' Wellington is by
            Cyclone, an' Cyclone is by Mohammed, an' Mohammed
            is by the Duke of Argyle, and he was good for 2:26.
            Madge's mother was from Petoskey Chief, an' she could
            go in three minutes."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Taylor has no blood as slow as three minutes," replied
            the major. "Taylor's sire was Aleck, he by King Henry,
            he by Maurice A., he by the Duke of Argyle. Taylor's
            dam was Matilda, sired by Cal, he by MarshalNey, he by
            Royal John. Matilda went in 2:28 on Long Island, and
            every horseman knows that Aleck could distance Wellington"
        </p>
        <p>
            "The proof of the puddin' is in the eatin'," said
            Sparks. "Madge T. could always go by Taylor."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Always?" said Ratke. "Sparks, did I not go by you
            coming from the donation at Osborne's?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," admitted Sparks, "an' didn't you run your
            horses, too?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Taylor did break up," returned Ratke. "But when
            you regain possession of Madge T., bring her over and I
            will try conclusions with you."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm afraid we won't race very quick," sorrowfully
            observed Sparks.
        </p>
        <p>
            They had now passed through the swamp and were
            approaching a dilapidated barn, beyond which was an
            unpainted frame-house.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Had we better stop here?" inquired one.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," was the answer. "They're hard customers.
            We better rout 'em up."
        </p>
        <p>
            The crowd, stopping their horses by the front gate,
            called the name of Wallace and uttered with it many an
            unnecessary and insinuating remark. At last a window
            was raised, a head thrust out and Wallace inquired,
        </p>
        <p>
            What do you want?"
        </p>
        <p>
            In spite of their want of respect for the place and its
            occupants, the party hesitated to answer the gruff
            interrogation. But Green, who was unscrupulous in wounding
            the feelings of others, boldly replied,
        </p>
        <p>
            "We wanted to know if you was at home."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm much obliged to you," said Wallace. "I like to
            be waked up out of a snooze to hear some half-baked
            nuisance ask if I'm to home. I s'pose you want to know
            next if the folks is all well."
        </p>
        <p>
            So saying, he shut down the window, and it was only
            after some severe threats that the band succeeded in
            bringing him back for a second interview.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There were some horses stole to-night," said Green,
            "and we thought that we would satisfy ourselves that you
            was at home."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You see I am," replied Wallace. "Now I wish you'd
            go off and mind your business."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Where is Ab?" inquired Green.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Abed, where all honest men ought to be," returned
            Wallace. "Got any more questions to ask?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "We don't know whether he's there or not," said Green.
            "Call him up."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ab, Ab," cried Wallace, "show these fools you're to
            home."
        </p>
        <p>
            A cord bedstead gave forth a dolorous groaning, and
            directly after the face of Ab appeared at a chamber
            window,
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now," said Wallace, "get out of here, or I'll let
            daylight through some of you,"
        </p>
        <p>
            This injudicious threat brought a shower of stones,
            which several substantial citizens, including Ratke and
            Holmes, in vain strove to prevent. Two windows were
            broken, a piece of one clapboard was split off and knocked
            down, and the house received other marks from the rocky
            bombardment. It was fortunate for Wallace, that some
            of the younger and more hot-headed of the party were at
            the barn looking at his horses. They drew out an old
            buggy and rummaged through the empty bay and stable.
            They even led out the horses to see if one of them
            were not Madge T. or Green's Billy in disguise. But the
            protruding ribs and low hanging heads were convincing
            proofs of the no non-identities of the steeds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The morning was near at hand, and, tired and discouraged,
            the men retraced their steps across the swamp.
            "If we could only get our hands on 'em," said a man
            from Oakville who had lost a valuable Percheron in the
            winter. "I'd like to see 'em hanging to an oak limb."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The proper way to punish misdemeanor," replied the
            major, "is to execute sentence proceeding from a legally
            organized tribunal. The decisions of men unaccustomed
            to jurisprudence and unrestrained by the statutes are apt
            to be hasty. Your conduct toward Wallace illustrates my
            statement. You had not the slightest evidence against
            him, but you waked him up in the middle of the night,
            insulted him, and when he replied to your insults, stoned
            his house and threatened to do him bodily injury."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There didn't any of it come amiss," was the response.
            "If he didn't deserve it one time, he did another."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The greatest and most widespread danger to society,"
            said the major, "is lawlessness. It is in the rural
            districts, in high places, among the legislators themselves.
            Citizens whose general morals are irreproachable, who
            read the Bible and strive to abide by its teachings, forget
            that they should remain subject to the powers that be.
            It matters not whether the act of disobedience be the
            spearing of a fish in May, the shooting of a quail out of
            season, or the illegal hanging of a horse-thief; the effect
            is the same, for it brings contempt of the law. The
            insubordination thus fostered, building upon precedents
            unintended as such by their authors, walks with mobs in
            cities, overthrows the virtue and very existence of states,
            and spreads panic and instability among the nations.
            We must not be rash in following our projects of vengeance."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Rash, or no rash," said the Oakville man, "I'd help
            put 'em where they wouldn't do any more mischief."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If am along when they are captured," returned Ratke,
            "and any injury is attempted, I will defend them
            to the best of my ability."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's the talk," exclaimed the fellow in the white hat
            who was an admirer of Ratke's courage. "And I'm with
            you every time, Major. We'll turn 'em over to the law,
            and we won't give 'em anything more than a good sound
            drubbing."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You'll see," replied the obstinate Oakville man. "If
            we can't hang 'em, I'll put some cold lead into 'em."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Afore you hang 'em or shoot 'em," said Jake Sheppard,
            "hadn't you better catch 'em?"
        </p>
        <p>
            At the western extremity of the swamp they stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Gentlemen," began the major, "we have made as
            thorough a search as we could under the circumstances.
            But we can do no more without organization. Random
            efforts will avail us nothing. In order to recover the stolen
            property we must plan, and plans are quite certain of
            failure when they are known to a strong and vigilant
            enemy. If the measures we adopt are understood throughout
            the country, they will be revealed to the thieves. I
            think we ought to choose a committee of five to direct our .
            movements. This committee should have the power of
            making its deliberations secret or public, as it may deem
            proper."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The major is right," said Holmes. "It won't do to
            let everybody know just what we are going to do. I move
            that we have an executive committee of five."
        </p>
        <p>
            The motion was passed, and the party chose, as members
            of the committee. Holmes, Ratke, Sparks, Green and
            Montcalm, of whom the latter was nominated by the
            major. Ratke's house was selected as the location for a
            temporary committee room, and two o'clock that afternoon
            named as the hour of meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The business concluded, the band dispersed. The
            major's farm hands, with the exception of Archer, who had
            been too sleepy to join the hunt, commenced to do the
            chores.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, Trace," said the major after breakfast, "I am
            going to take a nap. You were disturbed of your rest.
            Come in the house and lie down."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thank you," replied Montcalm. "I slept well the
            forepart of the night, and I am not very tired."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I know what is the trouble with you," said Ratke.
            "You do not want the gentler sex to suspect that you are
            so weak as to feel fatigue. I do not blame you. Go and
            lie down in the club-house."
        </p>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2><a id="Page_86"></a>
            CHAPTER IX.<br>
            <small>HOW THE AFFAIR ENDED.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            The deliberations of the committee lasted several
            hours. Ratke convinced his associates that the horses
            were hidden in the swamp, and that, consequently, the roads
            surrounding that portion near which the animals disappeared
            should be watched. The supervision of these
            roads, which had an extent of eight miles, was divided
            between the five members of the committee. Each member
            was to find enough men systematically to guard the
            part apportioned him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm cleverly secured the division extending
            eastward from Takum's. He also obtained permission of
            the major to engage his hands. Avoiding Sheppard and
            Wrengell, he secured the services of Daggett, Brown,
            Thompson, and that still more valuable acquisition, Archer,
            whom he promised some blankets and cigars and instructed
            to pass the night as comfortably as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some bushes near the road Montcalm left the
            blankets which he had promised Archer. At Break o'Day
            he hired two topers whom he found in Dr. Rorus' drugstore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jimmy Martin and old John Davis, the men whom he
            engaged, were chronic inebriates. They were harmless
            as doves, but not wise as serpents. They worked much
            of the time by the day, and money they valued solely as a
            means by which liquor was obtained. They accepted the
            offer of the committee-man, because it necessitated no
            hard work and because it promised better remuneration
            than common labor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm knew that criticism would be made on his
            action in engaging such inefficient sentinels, but he was
            in a desperate strait which required the use of desperate
            expedients. It was possible for him in a measure to avert
            suspicion. In the presence of three listeners he refused
            their request to be supplied with whisky, saying that they
            must remain sober during the night. Moreover, he told
            them that, if they took a drop of the beverage with them,
            he should secure other help.
        </p>
        <p>
            At dusk he posted his guards. Commencing at the
            point where his division joined that of Ratke, he placed
            his men in the order named: Martin, Davis, Archer,
            Takum, Thompson, Brown, Daggett.
        </p>
        <p>
            These were, as he afterward claimed, all the sentinels
            whom he could procure, Archer's position was near a
            creek, the laggard waters of which were moving toward
            the first of a chain of lakes connected with the Huron
            River, Near him and leading toward the highway was an
            old road which had been used in the transportation of poles
            from the interior of the swamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here," said Montcalm, drawing the blankets from
            some alder bushes where they were concealed, "you
            will have a comfortable time."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I hope so," said Archer. "Planting corn is hard work
            when you drive it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If you hear any disturbance," ordered Montcalm, "you
            call me. You need not stay on your feet continually.
            Once an hour, or once every two hours, you can go to the
            bridge and back. But do not let any one know that you
            are favoring your legs in the least."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, I won't," assured Archer. "Folks don't seem to
            realize that a laboring man gets tired. You spoke something
            about some cigars, Mr. Montcalm,"
        </p>
        <p>
            "So I did," said Montcalm, handing him a half-dozen
            of the desired gifts, which had a superior flavor to which
            Archer was unaccustomed. "I must go and look to
            Takum. Do you think he will do his duty?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, I don't know," replied Archer. "The trouble
            with Phleet Takum is, he's lazy. He'll never set the
            North River afire."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How are you feeling?" asked Montcalm, as he joined
            Takum.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Not very bumkum," answered the subordinate. "I
            was nigh scart to death las' night, I thought they was
            a-comin' right into the house an' goin' to drag me out.
            They'd hang a feller sure if they got their claws on him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are right," said Montcalm. "But they will not
            get their claws on us."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How be we goin' to help ourselves?" queried Takum.
            "They'll hunt the swamp to-morrer, and they'll have
            them horses as sure as preachin'."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We will look to that," said Montcalm,
        </p>
        <p>
            "I know what we can do," said Philetus. "You an'
            me can take 'em out up toward Will Archer. He'll be to
            sleep in an hour, an' thunder an' lightin' won't wake him.
            He's too lazy to stand for a sign-post."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We will let them stay for the present," replied Montcalm.
            "I want you to do an errand for me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "'Tain't far to go, is it ?" asked Philetus. "Ever
            since las' night I've been afraid o' my shadder."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Up past Wallace's," said Montcalm, taking two quart
            bottles from his pocket. "Carry these bottles under your
            jacket, just as you did the chicken. Give one of them to
            Davis and one to Martin. But do not say that I sent them.
            Make them believe that you came without my knowledge,
            and that I would not like it if I knew it. Be particular
            about this."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," assented Philetus. "But what are you goin' to
            do with the horses? They'll find them to-morrer as sure as
            preachin'."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The first thing to be done," said Montcalm, "is to go
            with the whisky bottles. You must do exactly as I tell
            you now. I was patient with you last night, but I will
            stand no more such work. I want you to go there and
            get back as soon as you can. Remember, this is no time
            to steal chickens."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I ain't had no hankerin' to since las' night," responded
            I Takum gloomily. "Gosh all Friday! I wish I was out o'
            this. It seems to me I'd git them horses away."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You recollect that I often had to warn you about talking
            too much," said Montcalm. "Do what I tell you and
            no more. Go with the bottles, come back and stay here."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," answered Philetus, "they won't nobody hear a
            yip out o' me, only Jimmy an' ole John an' you."
        </p>
        <p>
            After satisfying himself that his threats and the fear of
            popular vengeance had impressed Takum with the
            necessity of caution, Montcalm went to his post, which
            was east of the swamp. He held a short conversation with
            each of several neighbors who passed him. Leaning over
            the broken-down gate in front of the unattractive house,
            he talked a few minutes with Wallace, who complained of
            the rough treatment which he had received from the band
            in pursuit of the horse-thieves. The hour of eleven was
            approaching when he proceeded toward the sentinels
            whom he had placed at the extremity of his division.
            Old John was standing in an attitude of meditation by the
            fence, with his hands grasping the top rail and his body
            unsteadily waving about. Unconscious that he was
            watched, he staggered to a jug and emptied a quart of
            liquid, a part into his throat, a greater portion down his
            shirt collar. With more volume than melody floated a
            song from Jimmy Martin, which showed that Philetus had
            faithfully performed his errand. Montcalm on his return
            stopped at Wallace's house and knocked. There was no
            light inside, but the door shortly opened and he was
            admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I was tired and I went to bed," said Wallace. "I'll
            light the lamp. Ab, get up."
        </p>
        <p>
            The cord bedstead in the chamber groaned, and in a
            few minutes Ab appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
            "We'll take a turn at seven up," said Wallace. "Draw
            up your chair, Montcalm."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Count me in, too. Pa," said a large, rawboned, masculine
            looking girl, whose freckled face pushed through the
            opening door of an adjoining bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Jule," exclaimed Wallace, "who told you to get up? "
        </p>
        <p>
            "I told myself," replied Julia. "If there's any fun, I'll
            have my share, and don't you forget it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Those windows ought to be darkened," remarked
            Montcalm. "If I should be seen here, I might be
            accused of neglecting my duty."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Here, you, Ab," exclaimed Julia, grabbing her brother
            by the shoulders and jerking him backward from his chair,
            "run upstairs and get a quilt."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't be too smart, Jule," warned Wallace. "You
            may get set back a peg. That girl's a trump," he said to
            Montcalm, as Julia disappeared in another room. "I
            wish Ab was like her. If she was a boy, they'd have to
            stand 'round for her. She and Ab don't always agree.
            They fight like cats and dogs, and Jule is about enough
            for him."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, Ab," whispered Julia, meeting that individual in
            his descent from the stairs, "don't you take that old quilt
            in there for Mr. Montcalm to see. It ain't fit. You get
            the cat's-paw."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't know nothin' about any cat's-paw," said Ab,
            aloud. "You can't make any cat's-paw of me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hatefulness," replied Julia, giving him a push and
            running up the stairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Julia brought down the cat's-paw and lugged out the
            best quilt from the spare bedroom. These she put over
            the windows, and at Montcalm's suggestion looked about
            for something to fill the keyhole of the back-door. Passing
            by carpet rags and old clothing, she went to her box
            of choicest finery, and from it selected a red ribbon which
            she stuffed into the keyhole, taking pains to leave an end
            of it hanging down for her visitor's inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You and me can beat pa and Ab at seven-up. Can't
            we, Mr. Montcalm?" she said, smoothing the pendent
            strip of silk.
        </p>
        <p>
            "They was rough on us last night," said Wallace, shuffling
            the cards with dexterity." It beat all how they tore
            around. They marked the house all up with rocks, and
            turned the horses loose, and run the buggy out. They
            hit one of the wheels against something and cracked two
            of the spokes, and maybe three. It's a good thing they
            went just as they did. If they hadn't, one of them would
            have got a lead pill."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ab," cried Julia, "quit looking over my hand, or your
            ears'Il catch a warmin'."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Shut up," growled Wallace, his looks betraying an
            admiration which the severity of his language did not imply.
            "That's a girl such as you don't often see, Montcalm.
            She's helped Ab an' me a good deal. She's worked out for
            almost every one. She understands about the houses and
            barns and horses, and how late the folks say up. That
            comes real handy."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You bet I can help," put in the masculine Julia. "If
            anybody where I worked got up to watch pa and Ab, I'd
            rattle things around in the house so they could hear.
            Clubs is trumps, Trace. Ab, you look out or you'll get
            your chops slapped."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You have engaged in a very profitable business, Mr.
            Wallace," said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You can't tell me anything about the business," said
            Wallace." The time I went on the raid over in Eaton I
            just got away with my life. They caught the horse and
            just missed me. The first thing after I go into it again,
            my house is stoned and my property destroyed. Oh, I've
            had experience enough."
        </p>
        <p>
            "This venture is likely to be more profitable," asserted
            Montcalm. "You have already received twenty dollars."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I've earned it too," replied Wallace. "Hacking away
            at them tamaracks and wading out to get to 'em ain't any
            fun. I noticed you didn't do much of it. It was small
            pay I got."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It was better than raising wheat at a dollar a bushel,"
            said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No one but fools will grow wheat," returned Wallace.
            "I can get it easier from barns than from the ground. I
            won't have my ribs smashed by plow-handles to raise
            provender for some bloated bondholder. The capitalists
            have got it all their own way, and they wouldn't give a
            cent to keep us from standing to death. The laboring
            man has got to look out for himself. The rich ones
            won't look out for him. You can take five bushels of
            wheat from three or four bins, and it won't be noticed,
            but when you take a horse, there's an everlasting
            pow-wow."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You can get your provisions that way," said Montcalm,
            "but you will want money for other things."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, Pa," cried Julia. "And I want some dresses
            and rings, and you promised me a breastpin."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, yes, you want," grumbled Wallace --- "you want a
            good deal, but you won't get it. Montcalm, hadn't you
            better pay me for them jugs of cider that you had me
            take to Jimmy and old John? That's worth thirty cents
            a gallon -- sixty cents."
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," answered Montcalm, as he felt in his pocket
            for some silver. "It is right that you should have it."
        </p>
        <p>
            Presently Montcalm arose and stated his intention to
            leave.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Not yet," said Julia, "not till you play another game
            of euchre. Pa and Ab are ahead of us now,"
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is impossible for me to stay longer," replied Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, we'll see," said Julia. "If I don't let you go, it
            ain't impossible."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You must excuse me this time," said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, you don't," cried the unfeminine Julia, making a
            spring toward him and throwing her arms about him as he
            moved to the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Smack him, Jule," said Wallace, and the daughter
            obeyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, feeling very foolish and thinking that for
            once his flattery had brought him not the most pleasant
            results, writhed from her grasp and fled from the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You'll come again, will you?" demanded Julia.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, I certainly shall," answered Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "When?" asked Julia --- "next Sunday night? "
        </p>
        <p>
            "I cannot promise," said Montcalm. "I will come as
            soon as possible."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If you don't come then, there'll be a racket," said
            Julia; and with this warning she shut the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That'll make a fine woman for somebody," said
            Wallace. "Wouldn't she be the boss for a night-raider?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Perhaps," said Montcalm, "if he wished to get married.
            Ab, go up and see how Jimmy and old John get
            along, while I take a turn through the swamp."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, as he had expected, found Archer wrapped
            in the shelter of some bushes, oblivious to hi
            surroundings. His visit to Takum convinced him that he need
            have no fears concerning the faithfulness of that subordinate.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, Mr. Montcalm," whispered Philetus, "I ought to
            tell you somethin'. Will you be mad if I talk?"
        </p>
        <p>
            By no means," answered Montcalm. "Talk on. Phleet."
        </p>
        <p>
            "There's some one a-gittin' ready to muckle us," said
            Philetus. "I heard 'em a-talkin' together down yonder,
            an' they went in the tamaracks."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will go and see," said Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            His trip was far from satisfactory. There remained not
            one of the hired men who had been stationed along the
            road. He refrained from relating his discovery to the
            Wallaces, who, he feared, might be intimidated by the
            revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
            "They're as quiet as they can be," remarked Ab, as the
            three men met." That whisky and cider together laid
            'em right out."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We must hurry," said Montcalm." We have no time
            to lose."
        </p>
        <p>
            They took an angling course toward the swamp. When
            they reached the tamaracks they commenced to remove
            the sharpened trees in the manner which had so surprised
            Philetus. This road was shorter than the one which led
            to the hiding-place of the animals from the opposite side.
            It extended to an open strip, in the center of which ran
            the creek, whose banks were overflowed. A distance below
            was a boat which reached nearly across the stream.
            The men got into the boat. Montcalm pushed once with
            the paddle, and they stopped on the opposite shore.
            Twenty minutes later and they were untying the stolen
            Billy and Madge T.
        </p>
        <p>
            The horses, apparently willing to leave the loneliness of
            their retreat for a common equine habitation, gave little
            trouble until they came to the creek, where they snorted
            and stood with their feet braced, yielding only to the
            persuasion of some long whips.
        </p>
        <p>
            The creek crossed, they were led out, both at once, by
            the three men. Wallace suggested that Ab should
            rearrange the newly cut path while he and Montcalm
            attended to the stolen beasts, but the more prudent
            superior would not consider the proposition. With his own
            hands he replaced most of the trees and moved others
            which the Wallaces did not place to suit him. He scattered
            brush and fallen trees plentifully along the route,
            not, he said, so much for the purpose of covering the
            signs of travel as of inducing the searchers to keep away
            from the disguised road by going around the obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Maybe you're in love with this work, but I ain't," said
            Wallace, as, after leaving the tamaracks, he was tramping
            through the water, which reached above his boot tops.
            "This is fun. I suppose about to-morrow night the
            crowd'll come along and tear down my bam and burn my
            shanty over my head."
        </p>
        <p>
            "We have no expectation of getting caught," replied
            Montcalm, expressing a confidence which he did not feel.
            "We had better go as silently as we can. Probably we
            and the guards are the only ones in the neighborhood
            who are astir, but it is best to use caution."
        </p>
        <p>
            Had Montcalm acquainted the Wallaces with the facts
            communicated by Takum he might have been in his
            extremity deserted by his help, whose selfishness would
            have allowed no consideration for him to endanger their safety
            or that of their property. For this reason he encouraged
            them and quieted their fears, using tactics exactly opposite
            to those which he employed in the management of
            Philetus.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ah," said Wallace, when they had arrived at his barn,
            "go in and get that crank on the girt."
        </p>
        <p>
            Ab soon returned, bringing a crank and an iron bar to
            which was attached a short chain. Wallace took the bar
            and inserted one end of it in a comer of the barn, while
            the other protruded through a post which was set near.
            In front of the barn was a long stack of hay, which
            appeared to rest on the ground. Montcalm in the mean time
            had laid down some straight, smoothly hewn rails, thus
            forming a tramway between the post and the end of the
            stack. Raising some locks of the dried marsh grass, he
            fastened an end of a short rope to either side of a car
            which supported the stack. Then he joined the short
            ropes to a longer one, which he connected with the chain
            by a hook, and next he set the crank on an iron bar.
            Montcalm and Wallace turned the handle of this
            contrivance, when the stack trundled slowly forward and
            stopped within a few feet of the post.
        </p>
        <p>
            "There," said Wallace. "That's all I'll turn. I won't
            break my back over a crank."
        </p>
        <p>
            The removal of the stack exposed to view a pit which
            had been dug underneath the barn. So carefully
            performed had been the work of excavation that, when the
            entrance of the cellar was covered by the hay, its existence
            would not have been suspected by one unacquainted with
            the secret; and neither about the barnyard nor in sight
            of it was visible a trace of the dirt, the transfer of which
            must have occupied some weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That work was well done," observed Montcalm.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thanks and compliments is cheap," answered Wallace.
            "I wish I had what pay I ought to have. I'll never work
            so cheap again."
        </p>
        <p>
            The horses did not fancy entering the underground
            stable. The colt hung back, braced his feet, and was
            induced to go in only by the use of the whip, or as Wallace
            termed it, "the persuader."
        </p>
        <p>
            The stack was pushed to its first position without the
            help of a lever, as the ground ascended toward the post.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You had better get into the house," observed Montcalm.
            "You may be seen by some prowlers."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm visited the drunken guards from Break o'Day.
            He shook them, broke their bottles and jugs and
            complained bitterly of their neglect. While he was still
            shaking and lecturing Martin, he heard a long-drawn yell,
            which, as he instantly surmised, proceeded from Archer.
            With many misgivings he sped toward the spot from which
            the disturbance issued. Justice was on his track.
            Takum's only guaranty of trustworthiness was his fear;
            Wallace cared for self alone, and here was a new trouble,
            which he could barely locate, much less define. In front
            of Wallace's barn he met Archer, who was much excited.
        </p>
        <p>
            "They've gone," said Archer. "They've got away with
            the horses."
        </p>
        <p>
            "How do you know?" asked Montcalm, with an apprehension
            which he succeeded in hiding.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Because I saw 'em," replied Archer," and I thought
            I'd come up here and tell you."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm soon decided on his course of action. He
            would tell the Wallaces of Archer's disclosure, and prepare,
            when necessity demanded, to flee from the danger which
            menaced him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Where did the horses go?" he inquired.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Up the road," answered Archer.
            "Up the road!" ejaculated Montcalm in astonishment.
            "Yes," said Archer, "they come out of the old road in
            the swamp where they used to haul fence-posts through."
        </p>
        <p>
            Montcalm, relieved, though perplexed, left Archer on
            his beat and went to the station of Philetus, which was
            deserted. He called loudly, but two or three minutes
            elapsed before a faint response came from the swamp.
            Making his way through the tamaracks, which at that
            point were large and comparatively far apart, he found
            Takum, who was coming to meet him.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh, Mr. Montcalm!" exclaimed Philetus, "somebody
            got 'em and' they'll find us! We're gone up! Great
            Augustus! I'm a goin' to Californy!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "We are all right," consoled Montcalm. "Did you
            not expect that I would get the horses? If I had not
            taken them from the swamp, we would surely have
            been found out."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Was that all?" said Philetus. "I heard somebody
            a-comin' through that road, an' I thought they'd found
            the horses. They raised a great hellaballoo an' run
            up this way. I didn't think you'd make such a noise,
            but it ain't none o' my bisness, an' I won't talk about it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Get back to your post," said Montcalm. "You must
            let no one suspect that you were frightened."
        </p>
        <p>
            In the road Montcalm discovered the horses' tracks,
            and, following them along the highway, which was quite
            deserted, he ascertained to his surprise that they led
            to Ratke's barns.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he was passing the club-house on the way to the
            family dwelling, his attention was arrested by the sound
            of voices and laughter, and as he stopped, he overheard
            the words of Daggett, who was saying:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Didn't we have a time of it waking him, though? I
            poked him with a pole two minutes before he give a
            grunt. But he flew around lively enough after he did
            get up."
        </p>
        <p>
            By nine o'clock in the forenoon a body of men and boys,
            to the number of two hundred, had assembled at Ratke's.
            Carrying a variety of arms, including, rifles, shotguns,
            revolvers, rusty swords and muskets with bayonets attached,
            they proceeded in a body to the swamp, where they
            separated in order to facilitate their search.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old men stayed on the hard land, while the younger
            portion of the crowd, among which were a few boys, struck
            out boldly for the tamaracks. But their ardor, as well as
            their persons, was dampened by the water, which for the
            greater part of the year encircled the great swamp, and
            against which, at that time, the highest rubber boots were
            an imperfect protection. The water poured over the
            boot-tops of the men. The brush scratched the bare legs of
            the boys, who had rolled up their trousers. All were
            annoyed by the bushes, which in many places were so thick
            that vision was limited to a distance of a few feet. One
            by one, wet, tired and discouraged, the searchers returned
            to the up-land, asserting that a horse would not venture
            where they had been, and that no one but old Ratke would
            have imagined the thing. With their zeal for the capture
            of the thieves considerably lessened, they returned to their
            homes, disgusted with their own folly in being drawn into
            any scheme projected by the inventor of the New Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jimmy Martin and old John Davis boasted of how they
            secured the liquor in spite of Montcalm's precautions.
            This was an incident of the hunt at which the people
            laughed heartily, and Montcalm was glad to be subjected
            to ridicule instead of suspicion.

            CHAPTER X.<br>
            <small>TWO KINDS OF BUD BLOSSOM.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            The author whose ambition is that of the rural historian
            will not attempt scientifically to analyze the causes
            which led to the circumstances herein to be described.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the reader it may seem improbable, but certain it is
            that John Wrengell was received with more favor by the
            Ratkes. The traditions which might have thrown light
            upon the subject were imperfectly kept. Brown, Thompson
            and Daggett, excellent authorities on farm-life and the
            hunt after the horse-thieves, forgot those trifling incidents,
            of which reminiscences would have assisted us in our
            speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
            John and Manie began to be better acquainted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrengell's manners and habits were undergoing a
            change, whether for the better is a question on which the
            student and the man of fashion would differ. He was
            entering the period which at some age is reached by most
            men, the epoch of the anxiety to improve the personal
            attractions. Had he possessed an opportunity he would
            have been tempted to barter a part of his hard-earned
            learning for a more perfect understanding of proprieties.
            At the church he saw Fred Loomis, and envied him his
            style. Dr. Rorus' clerk was not brilliant. Indeed, he
            seemed to be an automatic, imitative body, wound up for
            life without the troublesome complication of a brain. His
            walk was unmistakably that of the young man who is assured
            of his gentility, and his hat was tipped at exactly
            the right angle to be fashionable.
        </p>
        <p>
            John, before going to Oakville to purchase a suit of
            clothes, took observations of Loomis' apparel. The
            dress suit, his first extravagance, was praised by the
            clothier as a perfect fit. John did not mistrust that the
            trousers were too short, or that the loose coat hung in
            wrinkles about his shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sunday morning after the important purchase he
            took extraordinary pains with his attire. But the clothes
            brush was filled with the lint of the club-house, and the
            blacking-brush, which had been used on greasy boots,
            would not impart to bis shoes a perfect shine.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was before the mirror, trying to smooth down an
            obstinate lock of hair, when Daggett thus addressed him:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Fix it up nice, John. I would if I was in your place.
            If you go in the parlor now, you'll find her alone. She's
            singing, and all the rest of them are in the sitting-room."
        </p>
        <p>
            John determined to make a terrible rejoinder, but before
            he prepared it, he was assaulted by Brown and
            Thompson, and he was unable to reply to them all. For
            the purpose of escaping the notice of his fellows he went
            to the orchard, and walked around it in pretended abstraction
            till he came to its western side. There, seated
            on the fence, he chewed splinters from the rails and waited
            for the keen-eyed Daggett to turn his attention elsewhere,
            so that his arrival in front of the house might not be seen
            by the fun-loving hired man. When this occupation became
            monotonous, he slid from his position and started
            across the orchard.
        </p>
        <p>
            The warm May days had strewn verdure over the limbs
            of the apple-trees. Leaves had pushed out, and buds had
            developed to blossoms. Dressed in pink and white, the
            blossoms, stirred by a strong wind, posed in different
            attitudes, and at each ample swing cast off a portion of their
            loveliness. A few rods ahead of John was Manie, standing
            with her back toward him beneath a tree. About her,
            as if in homage, were falling the dismembered blossoms.
            As the wind lifted her hair and threw a shower of the
            white leaves on her shoulders, he thought it would be no
            misfortune, if he and she, like Una and the red-cross
            knight, could be lost in a wood,

            She Stretched her hand upward, trying to get possession
            of a bough which was beyond her reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let me help you," said John, stepping quickly to her
            side. "I will pull it down, and you can make the
            selection you wish."
        </p>
        <p>
            John purposely held the bough so high that, to reach it,
            she was obliged to raise herself on tiptoe and remain very
            close to him until the desired flowers were obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I wanted these," said Manie, "because they are fresher
            than the others. These are just opened, while most of
            them are ready to fall. What do you think of our apple
            grove, Mr. Wrengell?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think it is a kingly court," replied John, "in which
            reigns an absolute monarch. The advent of summer
            holds perfect sway over our fancy. Of all periods the
            beginning of a progressive era is most interesting. When
            a state or system has been established a considerable
            length of time, it is no longer able to draw the strongest
            admiration; but awakening life is never without its charms.
            That line of woods is now in its richest beauty. There
            can be nothing more picturesque than the spot where
            that dark green tree is set diagonally in front of the less
            deeply tinted background. As its fellows advance to the
            same stage of development, the view will grow less
            attractive. The reign of this scene around us over human
            sympathies is transitory, for those white petals are now
            falling. In a few days the trees will be clad in simple
            green, and in the autumn they must surrender their
            authority and yield tribute to those whom they have ruled."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The summer brings to the orchard little loss of
            authority," said Manie. "You may prefer blossoms to
            fruit, but Phleet Takum's little boys will not neglect yonder
            tree when it is loaded with yellow pippins. There are
            Seven of our hired men. Only one of them goes a rod
            out of his way to look at leaves and flowers, but they will
            all come trooping over here as soon as they are assured
            that harvest-apples are ripe. How many of the farmers
            stay in their orchards all day now? How many of them
            will keep away from them when it is time to gather fruit?
            You judge of an entire force by its application in one
            place. It has not the universality which you claim or
            imply that it possesses."
        </p>
        <p>
            John was in a dilemma. He believed that he ought to
            continue the argument in order to appear to advantage
            before Manie. But he had learned that in a nervous
            condition, such as he labored under at that moment, he was
            certain to make statements which were fatal to his logic.
            Furthermore, he might, under the influence of excitement,
            utter some discourteous remark, which would nullify any
            good impression which he might have made.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Are you going to meeting to-day?" he asked as Manie
            moved toward the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think so," answered Manie; "we usually go."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Can I go too?" inquired John, while his shaking
            fingers were picking at a blossom-covered apple-limb.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Of course you can," answered Manie. "Who is to
            prevent you? "
        </p>
        <p>
            "But," persisted John, "can I go with you?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "If there is room in the buggy you can," said Manie.
            "Nora, Aunt Maria and I can sit behind, and perhaps
            Uncle James will let you ride with him and Mr. Montcalm."
        </p>
        <p>
            "No," exclaimed John in desperation, while a flush
            overspread his face, "I mean will you go alone with me?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh!" said Manie, "that is a different matter. Yes, I
            will go!'
        </p>
        <p>
            John would have expressed his appreciation of the favor
            which he was receiving, but he had not mastered gallantry,
            and he was overwhelmed with a sense of his inefficiency
            as an escort. That which he could not speak he could
            act. Regard drew him near her, and the fear of repulse
            drew him back, so that he walked in a zigzag line across
            the orchard. He pushed aside branches of trees for her
            to pass; and, coming to some bars, he threw down all of
            them but the bottom one, which was caught at the end.
            He was tugging away at the unyielding board when Manie
            put an end to his strenuous efforts by stepping quickly
            over it.
        </p>
        <p>
            John left Manie at the house and hurriedly went to the
            road. He did not dream of the ridicule he was preparing
            for himself by his excited manner and walk.
        </p>
        <p>
            The drive to church furnished him the keenest enjoyment
            he had ever known. He was the escort of the most
            cultured, the most esteemed lady of that community.
            Samson-like, he was rending the bonds of his evil fortune
            and bearing away the Gazan gate which shut him within the
            city of disrepute. From the pit of degradation he raised
            his head above its mouth and viewed the hills of
            respectability, the borders of which he hoped soon to cross.
            He could think of nothing to say, and, indeed, he was too
            happy to talk. The wind placed invigorating touches on his
            face, and the wood to the south, with its thin light-colored
            drapery and its flank of dark tamaracks, sent to him an
            inspriation which found fellowship with his already awakened
            feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the church he was unpleasantly reminded of his abstraction
            by the discovery that he had driven too far from the platform
            for Manie conveniently to alight. Wishing to atone for his
            lack of skill by a show of agility, he endeavored to clear
            the distance by a leap, but as his feet caught in the lines,
            he was thrown on his hands and knees; and it was only by
            very energetic and undignified scrambling that he escaped
            falling to the ground. The boys and young men on the steps
            contented themselves by exchanging a few knowing looks. When,
            however, John had hitched his horse and awkwardly passed into
            the church, they commented freely on his behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this Sunday Ratke's favor toward Wrengell began to wane
            and Mrs. Grippin's began to increase. She admitted that John
            was a very good musician. He scraped his feet before he came
            into the house. He did not always wipe his hands in the
            center of the towel. He was, moreover, careful about
            disfiguring the butter-roll, and did not take more of the
            butter than he wanted on his plate.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was the time of May-baskets, and parties hanging these
            souvenirs had been about the neighborhood at night.
        </p>
        <p>
            John gathered some flowers from the swale which joined the
            swamp. He tied them with a ribbon which he had bought for that
            purpose, attached to them some poetry, hung them on the knob
            of the front door, rapped and ran to the road. These were the
            stanzas which Manie read:

                <small>THE ROOT OF AN EVIL.</small>
            </h2>

            <p>
                The summer was remarkably hot. July had arrived. The
                great swamp which, except in August, was usually too wet
                for a well-clad traveler to pass through with dry feet,
                was almost ungirded of its water-belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke and his sister were preparing to start for Sharptown.
                The preceding sentence should be amended by the addition
                that Mrs. Grippin was actively flying about, while the
                major was conning a treatise of Lord Shaftesbury's.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'd like to know where you got the money to pay Green?",
                said the housekeeper. "You hadn't ought to be afraid of
                me. I'm not going to tattle about it. You've got secret
                all to once, haven't you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I believe in maintaining silence when the occasion demands
                it," replied the major, " and it does in the present
                instance."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't care so much who you got the money of," said Mrs.
                Grippin, "as what you had to do to get it. You said you
                couldn't find it, and you'd hunted all over, and you didn't
                tell me any different till the other day. I'm afraid you
                had to do something desperate."
            </p>
            <p>
                I found the money to pay Green," said Ratke. "Further than
                that I can tell you nothing."
            </p>
            <p>
                "James Ratke," said Mrs. Grippin, breaking into tears, "I
                have slaved for you half life. I have looked to your
                interests when you were careless of them. I have cooked for
                your hired men and scrubbed floors till I have nearly broken
                myself down. Look at my hands, James Ratke! They have been
                crooked doing your washing and mending. I never wanted any
                pay. I only wanted to know that you was getting along, and
                that I could have a place to stay when I was so old I couldn't
                work. And now, when the home is going, you won't even tell
                me how long before I am turned out into the streets."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We will not believe that we are going to lose the place,"
                returned the major soothingly. "An honorable man holds
                the claim against it. I did not mean to hurt your feelings,
                Maria, or to manifest a lack of confidence in you. I
                appreciate what you have done for me and I mean to repay
                you, as far as I can, by making you comfortable in your
                old age."
            </p>
            <p>
                It was seldom that Mrs. Grippin was absent from the
                farm. This rare occurrence was welcomed with rapture
                by more than one whom it concerned. Archer was at
                liberty to help himself to bread and butter, whenever he
                chose. Brown and Thompson could have each two pieces
                of pie without encountering a savage glance which
                destroyed their appetites. Nora sat by Montcalm and talked
                and laughed with him in a way which would have shocked
                her proper aunt had that lady been present.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come in this way. Trace," she cried, rushing to the
                parlor. "It's cool in here. Oh my! isn't this a nice
                place? I'll shut the door," she said as Montcalm entered.
                "Then they can't hear what we say. Oh, Trace,
                we haven't had a chance to talk alone for a good while.
                Aunt Maria does watch us so close. I'm glad she's gone.
                It's the day Uncle James promised to pay Uncle Si, and
                he's gone after the money. I tell you it's a lot of it. It's
                over $14,000."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I should think Mr. Green would be afraid to have
                such a sum brought to his house," said Montcalm, "seeing
                that there are thieves about."
            </p>
            <p>
                "He had to have it brought here," explained Nora.
                "It was to be paid in this house, and then he takes a good
                deal of pains not to be robbed. He has the strongest
                locks on his house, a lock on every door and a burglar
                alarm besides."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is caution itself," said Montcalm. "It is not
                often that a house has a lock on every door. Generally
                some of them are bolted."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes," said Nora, "that is the way with Uncle Si's.
                He fastens the cellar door with a hook. I remember
                hooking that when I was a little girl. Then the hook was
                higher than my head. Now it comes up just to my shoulders."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have forgotten," said Montcalm. "It lacks a trifle of
                being as high as your shoulder."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you know about it?" asked Nora. "You never were
                there."
            </p>
            <p>
                I know by intuition," said Montcalm. "Second sight, perhaps
                you would call it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, bother your second sight," returned Nora. "Don't try
                to fool me in that way. Are you going away before long?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Perhaps," answered Montcalm. "I have thought of telling
                the major that I can work for him no longer."
            </p>
            <p>
                "And you'll send for me, as you said you would, when you
                get the store started." So saying, Nora sat in his lap and
                gave his collar a playful shake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Montcalm looked down pityingly into her face. He had
                not at first meant to win her affections. Feeling his
                power, he had determined to test it, and its exercise
                had made her his slave. The lies which he had told her
                were for the purpose of giving her temporary satisfaction,
                but they had doubled the difficulty in disentangling
                himself without giving her the pain which he dreaded
                to inflict.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do not count too much on the store," said Montcalm.
                "I am not now in the best of circumstances, and it may
                be years before I can start in business."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why!" exclaimed Nora, a disappointed look creeping
                across her face, "didn't you mean what you said?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes," answered Montcalm, as he felt unable to
                use the candor with which he had resolved to speak,
                "we will go just as we have intended. But be patient."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It wouldn't need so much to start a store in a little
                village like Break o'Day," said Nora. "You say you've
                got a few hundred. So have I. I've got one uncle and
                an aunt that's well off. Right here are two checks,
                Trace, " she said, coming from her bedroom with some
                papers. "They are for $500. Take them now. I won't
                want them. Aunt Emma gave me one and Uncle Si the
                other. You see I can help, and I feel just like
                helping to get along."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, no," expostulated Montcalm, thoroughly despising
                his own deceit. "I will not. I hope myself to earn the
                money soon."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes, take them," urged Nora. "It don't make any
                difference to me who has them, only I want to show you
                that I won't be a hindrance to you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, you will not," said Montcalm sorrowfully. "Keep
                your money, Nora. By and by we can share our property
                equally. But wait until we are married."
            </p>
            <p>
                At the sound of the last word Nora's face lighted up,
                and she pressed closer to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "When will that be. Trace?" she inquired. "We have
                talked about it, but we have never set the time. Once in"
                a while I think it never will be."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We must not be impatient," replied Montcalm. "It
                may be a year or two before I am ready to marry. If the
                delay interferes with your happiness, I will release you
                from your promise."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are tired of me," said Nora, her voice betraying
                her disappointment. "I was afraid you would be. But I
                won't beg for your favor if I die. I'll keep away from
                you, and I won't bother you any more."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What is my little girl thinking of?" asked the
                miserable Montcalm, drawing her back to him. "Does she
                imagine I am tired of her because I will not take her
                money? I could not do that, Nora. I would hate myself
                for such an act. We can wait awhile. Neither of us are
                old. I will prepare a home for you, and then I want you.
                We will be happy then."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I hear Aunt Maria talking in the dining-room!"
                exclaimed Nora. "She mustn't suspect that we've been
                in here together. Quick, Trace, slip right out of this door.
                I'll toss your hat out of the kitchen."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You go in, Major," said Montcalm, as he neared
                Ratke. "I will care for the team."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You may if you like," answered the major. "I am
                very hungry."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Grippin suspected that many misdemeanors had
                been committed during her absence. Nora should have
                been taking care of the dishes instead of sitting in the parlor.
                The men had not scraped their feet when they came into
                the house, they had left the butter in bad shape, and some
                of them had taken two pieces of pie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't be so long," said the housekeeper, as her
                brother leisurely entered the house. "He'll be here in a
                little while. You want to be ready to do business with
                him when he comes."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Precipitancy," replied the major, "is a common evil,
                and I intend that it shall not ruin me. If you think twice
                before you speak or act, you avoid many mistakes which
                you would otherwise make."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," answered Mrs. Grippin, "but if you are always
                thinking and never acting, it don't amount to much. I
                wish you'd eat so I can get my work done up."
            </p>
            <p>
                After dinner the major went to the bam to talk with
                Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come, Nora," said Mrs. Grippin. "Take hold and
                clear up the table. You're not very tired. It don't
                hurt you any more to work than it does me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Some one is at the door," said Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come in," said the housekeeper, as she ushered their
                expected guest into the parlor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are the folks all well?" asked Green, with a degree of
                politeness to which he was unaccustomed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well enough," returned Mrs. Grippin shortly. "James
                will be in in a few minutes. You can make yourself
                comfortable until he comes."
            </p>
            <p>
                Partly obeying the directions of the housekeeper. Green
                sat down, but he did not make himself comfortable. He
                arose to his feet, and strode about the room in an oval
                circuit, unconsciously following the same path through
                each evolution. When this became monotonous, he resumed
                his seat and tapped the floor alternately with his
                heel and his toe. As the major entered the apartment,
                he wsa again walking the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why, Uncle Si," said Nora, following closely after
                Ratke, "you haven't been here in a long time. Why
                don't you ever come around?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I don't get around to visit much," returned Green.
                "I have a good deal to do."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I should think you have a good deal to do," said
                Nora. "You never go anywhere only on business. If I
                was worth so much as you, I'd call around after my
                friends. You don't have so much leisure as lots of poor
                folks."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's what makes 'em poor," returned Green.
                "They have too much leisure."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How much do I owe you?" inquired Ratke, with a
                mixture of dignity and civility.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fourteen thousand five hundred and forty-two dollars
                and ninety-two cents," answered Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are mistaken," said Ratke. "The amount is
                fourteen thousand five hundred and forty-two dollars
                forty-one cents, four and sixty-three hundredths mills."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There ain't any mistake on my side," returned Green.
                "Collins is as good a lawyer as there is in Jackson, and
                he figured it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mr. Collins may be good authority," Ratke rejoined;
                "but the figures are better, and I will show them to you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I'm satisfied with Collins's work," said Green.
                "He's always done my business, and he's always straight."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No doubt you are satisfied," responded the major,
                "because his mistake, if sanctioned by me, would put a
                half dollar in your pocket. I oppose it, not for the
                half-dollar, but for the principle which is involved."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll take my mortgage and go home," said Green.
                "If I can't get what belongs to me in one way, I will in
                another."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Maria," called the major, "you and Manie come here.
                Here," he continued, addressing Green, "in the presence
                of three witnesses, I offer you fourteen thousand five
                hundred forty-two dollars, forty-one cents, four and
                sixty-three hundredths mills, or, on account of the
                difficulty in making change, fourteen thousand five
                hundred forty-two dollars and forty-two cents."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What is this about?" inquired Mrs. Grippin, looking
                in turn from Ratke to Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He wants to cheat me out of fifty-one cents," replied
                Green. "I tell him I'll take the mortgage and go home
                first."
            </p>
            <p>
                The money-lender shrank back as he saw the change in
                the aspect of Mrs. Grippin. Her form straightened, her
                upper lip rose with an expression of ferocity, her long
                fingers gripped together like the talons ot a destructive
                bird.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You, Josiah Green!" she said slowly. "You talk of
                cheating, you that never did anything but cheat!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, Maria," expostulated the major, "remember he is
                a guest in our house. We must not disgrace ourselves by
                treating him with discourtesy."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can't run me, James Ratke," retorted the angry
                woman, "if you do run the rest of the town. 'Tend to
                your own business, and I'll 'tend to mine. You bought a
                cow of him. Si Green, when you couldn't get trusted
                anywhere else. You got money to help you with the mortgage
                on your place, and you cheated him out of it. You got
                wheat of him when your family was sick, and you said
                they'd starve if they didn't have help. Do you remember
                you came here and said you'd like to get a few pounds of
                butter, and you'd pay for it the next week.' You've never
                said a word to me about that butter from that day to this.
                Now I want you to settle that account."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I won't bother about the half dollar. Major," said
                Green. "Have it as you want it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very well," said Ratke, "here is the full amount."
            </p>
            <p>
                "When do you intend to pay me for that butter?" asked
                Mrs. Grippin, as Green was retreating to the road. "Si
                Green, you get up in church and speak, and say you are
                glad you chose the better way. What better way do you
                mean.' A better way to smouse folks is the only way
                you've chose since I've known you. That's all the lingo
                you've got, and you can't make up another. I sit where I
                can see you in meeting. If you don't pay me for that
                butter, I'll look you right in the face as you speak. Then
                say you've chose the better way if you can."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How much is it?" asked Green, turning suddenly
                about.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There was four pounds and a half of the butter,"
                answered Mrs. Grippin, "and it was twenty cents a pound.
                That would he ninety cents. I'll call it six shillings."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here," said Green feeling that he deserved credit for
                generosity, "here is a dollar. That makes us square."
            </p>
            <p>
                Fearing that Mrs. Grippin would make another demand,
                the penurious farmer hastened to the road, untied his
                horse by a few quick, nervous jerks and drove rapidly
                away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ten minutes afterward, in response to the call of a
                neighbor, Ratke went out to the gate and received a
                letter, the body of which, written by Durgenson, is
                subjoined:
            </p>
            <p>
                "I dislike to speak about the sum I lent you. but the
                trouble is I am hard-pushed. I have got to have $4,000
                the 24th of this month. After that I will get along two
                or three hears without any more. Have it ready for me
                the afternoon of the 23rd, when I will come to your
                house."
            </p>

                CHAPTER XII.<br>
                <small>THE WELL WITH A BARREL CURB.</small>
            </h2>

            <p>
                Again at the dead of night Montcalm climbed from his
                bedroom window. Carrying a large bundle, he passed
                down the shaded walk and was soon on the route
                previously traversed by him and Takum. The sheep in
                the woods fled, as before, at his approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                He came presently to a pond the dimensions of which
                had manifestly shrunk during the hot weather, for a dry,
                barren circle marked where its edge had been. He untied
                his bundle, spread its contents on the ground and threw
                off his coat and vest, for which he substituted a thick,
                padded jacket which gave him a robust appearance.
                When to this disguise he added a mask from which
                straggled a sandy beard, no one would have recognized in
                the ruffianly looking figure the genteel Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the capacious hollow of an oak the adventurer stored
                the clothing which he had removed, and with his lightened
                bundle again proceeded on his way. Ere he reached the
                lane which led to the barns of Green, he deviated from his
                former route. Turning to the right, he emerged from the
                wood exactly in front of, though at a considerable distance
                from, the church. In a few minutes he was stalking along
                the edge of the graveyard, and a brief walk took him
                to a large wood pile which was close to the house of the
                money-lender.
            </p>
            <p>
                The premises had an aspect, not of thriftlessness, but
                of carelessness for everything unconnected with finance.
                The barns which sheltered the stock were well and neatly
                built. The house which harbored the family was paintless
                and old, the clapboards were loose, and some of the bricks
                had fallen from one chimney. It consisted of an upright
                and a long, low wing which lapped beyond the taller part
                of the dwelling. Montcalm was before the overlapping
                part and close to the outside cellar stairs. On the
                back-stoop were a swill-barrel, three swill-pails, some
                hoes and rakes and a rickety table made of a long box,
                on which sat pans and kettles. Whatever was useful merely
                in pleasing the eye or fancy was unnoticed by Green.
                Whatever added to his wealth received from him studious
                attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Montcalm went down the cellar stairs, which were in
                front of the stoop. His mask and padded jacket, annoying
                incumbrances in midsummer, he stripped off; and
                taking an auger from his bundle, he commenced to bore
                a hole in the cellar door, basing his calculations on the
                account which Nora had given him of its fastening. The
                noise, which he subdued as much as he could, might easily
                have been mistaken for the gnawing of a rat. He pushed
                through the orifice a wire instrument, and lifted a hook
                from the corresponding socket in which it rested. The
                door, which opened outwardly, he blocked with a stone,
                lest it should swing back and cause a strain on some
                attachment which he had not yet discovered. He bored a
                second and a third hole and cut out the spaces which
                intervened between them. Feeling through the passage
                thus formed, his hand came in contact with a string which
                he dared not critically examine. By means of the auger and
                a sharp knife he further enlarged the aperture until he
                could push through it his right arm and the fingers of his
                left hand, when, pulling the string tightly from him, he
                severed it with his knife and immediately after entered the
                cellar. An investigation showed the wisdom of his
                precautions. The string was connected with a burglar-alarm,
                which, if pulled, would have produced an explosion and
                might have brought ruin upon his enterprise, perhaps
                discovery to the intruder. Montcalm closed the door and
                lighted a small lantern. Boards which supported milk-pans
                were suspended from the floor above. In a remote
                corner of the cellar were some shelves which were in the
                course of erection. A broad-ax, a saw and some short
                boards which had been cut from the ends of the longer
                ones were on the upper of these shelves. Montcalm's
                curiosity was excited by a barrel, an end of which a few
                feet from the milk-shelves protruded some inches above
                the surface of the ground. On examination it was found
                to be the curbing of a well. When Green was poor, his
                ideas of economy told him that he could dig a well with
                less labor from the bottom of the pit under his house
                than from the surface of the ground; and, as he
                prospered, he provided water for his horses and cattle
                at the barn, but that necessity of his family was still
                carried from the cellar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Montcalm donned his mask and padded jacket, and again
                his exterior coincided with the nature of his errand.
                A second flight of stairs led to the upper rooms, and
                up these Montcalm passed, bearing his lantern. He stopped
                in front of a door, which he pushed gently back and
                forth. He knew it was possible that this door, too, was
                connected with a burglar-alarm, but he did not think it
                probable, as an intruder could reach it only by passing
                through another, for security of which greater than
                ordinary precautions had been used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gradually the door-bolt was worked from its socket, and
                Montcalm stepped into a small closet, from which he
                emerged into a larger room. Noiselessly going into the
                kitchen, he heard the light breathing of Green and his
                wife in their bedroom which was, he concluded, fastened
                against intrusion. Retreating to and through the closet,
                he traversed the room above the cellar and came to a
                flight of stairs, up which he climbed. One of the boards,
                as he stepped on it, gave a warning creak, and he lifted
                from it his foot and set it on the next stair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two bedrooms were partitioned from the main part of the
                chamber. In one of these on the floor was a spring-bed on
                which was a lying a man. As the man was long and the
                tick was short, about twenty inches of uncovered feet
                and legs were hanging over the bare springs. Beyond the
                legs were the lean body, the flaxen hair and weak,
                expressionless face of William Henry Harrison.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Montcalm by one of his long legs pulled him crosswise
                of the bed, the half-wit exclaimed, "Oh, Misser
                Green, 'tain't mornin' yet!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Tain't Misser Green," said Montcalm, "but it's some
                one that wants to see Misser Green. Tell him to come
                up here."
            </p>
            <p>
                Such was William Henry Harrison's terror at the rude
                awakening that he could only stare at the figure, whose
                broad shoulders and straggling sandy beard looked
                particularly savage in the light of the lantern.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Call Green up here," said Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no," answered William Henry Harrison, "I no
                call, I feel sick."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You must do as I tell you. Have him come up
                here."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No. He want to sleep. He git mad."
            </p>
            <p>
                "And I'll get mad if you don't call him," said Montcalm.
                "Tell him to come quick."
            </p>
            <p>
                "He whip me," objected William Henry Harrison.
                "Take a big strap. Maybe he kick."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you going to do as I want you to?" asked
                Montcalm, shaking him violently.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Misser Green," called William Henry Harrison.
                "Misser Green, come up here!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Call him again," ordered Montcalm, after he had
                waited to no purpose for a response.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, Misser Green, Misser Green, come up here quick!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Keep still there, William Henry Harrison," shouted
                Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell him you are sick," commanded Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come up here," William Henry Harrison called. "I
                sick."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get well then," was Green's answer. "I guess you
                ain't in much danger. I want to go to sleep."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell him you are awful sick," said Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, Misser Green," wailed the fearful half-wit, "I
                awful sick, I goin' to die."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You'll die if you don't shut up," replied Green. "I'll
                come up there and drive you through the floor. Now you
                keep still, I don't want to be awake all night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell him you are going to have a fit," was Montcalm's
                next order, "Tell him you know it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, Misser Green, I goin' to have a fit. I tell. I feel
                it. Oh, come up now!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll give you a fit if I come up there," yelled Green,
                thoroughly exasperated, "Now don't let me hear another
                word out of you to-night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell him you are going to have a hard fit," said Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no. He come up. He whip."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Say it quick," ordered Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He say he kill me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "And I'll kill you if you don't."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, don't kill. Hurt. Make blood. Awful."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then," said Montcalm, "tell him you are going to have a fit,
                and you know you are going to break things."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, Misser Green," cried the half-wit in desperation,
                "I goin' to have awful fit. I break window. I break bed.
                I break house."
            </p>
            <p>
                Montcalm emphasized the appeal by knocking out some
                pane of glass, which went ringing below to the cellar wall
                and stairs. He also jerked the bed, breaking a crosspiece,
                and struck the wall so violently that a yard of loose
                plaster fell from the ceiling to the floor. Then he closed
                his dark lantern.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What's that full up to?" exclaimed Green, jumping out
                of bed and hastily putting on his trousers. "I'd rather
                have a man of sense around and pay him wages that to
                bother with an idiot. I'll be right after you, young man!"
                he threatened as he proceeded toward the chamber.
                "I'll thrash you with an inch of your life! You won't
                be having any more fits or fussing for one while. What
                is this?" he demanded, as his bare foot struck the plaster
                which had fallen in the main part of the chamber. "What
                fool's caper is this?"
            </p>
            <p>
                He started suddenly backward as Montcalm, stepping
                from the door of the bedroom, presented a pistol at his
                head.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell me where your money is," said the unwelcome
                visitor. "I can't stay here long because my wife expects
                me home."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What money?" asked Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The money you got to-day," replied Montcalm, assuming
                a tone which corresponded with his rough garb. "You
                can't fool me. I know you've got it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's gone," said Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You lie," said Montcalm, clutching him by the throat.
                "Let me know where it is, or I'll blow your brains out."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is gone," Green affirmed," that is, the most of it.
                I took it over to Sharptown, and I got back just at dark.
                I've got two thousand dollars that I saved out for Osborne.
                You can ask Jane and she'll tell you the same."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Show me the two thousand then," said Montcalm, as
                he pushed the slide to his lantern," and don't you dare
                hang back, or play me any tricks. Here, you fellow on
                the bed, you lie where you are till I come back. And
                don't you stir. I'll lay this quilt over your legs, just in
                this way, and I can tell if it is moved. If I find a wrinkle
                of it changed, I'll shoot you when I come back."
            </p>
            <p>
                So saying, Montcalm adjusted the quilt and followed
                Green, who in silence led the way to the cellar. As they
                were leaving the small closet, Montcalm's foot
                accidentally hit a pair of rubber boots, which went
                tumbling down the stairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There it is," said Green, as he pointed to the cellar
                wall. "It's behind that stone. You couldn't tell it's
                loose, but it is. You'll find it all in a long pocket-book."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I rather you'd get it," replied Montcalm, following him
                to see that nothing of value was left In the hiding-place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The loose stone was near the unfinished milk-shelves
                and to reach it the men were obliged to step over a long
                board which lay across some saw-horses. Montcalm deposited
                his lantern on the board and vigilantly watched the
                execution of his order. Reluctantly stepping over another
                saw-horse and removing the stone from the mortar,
                which at first sight appeared to be solid. Green drew out
                a long pocket-book and handed it to Montcalm. They
                again stepped over the saw-horse, and Montcalm, opening
                the pocket-book, examined its contents. Green saw passing
                from him part of the riches the slave of which he had
                been and still was. For it he had plowed, sown and
                reaped, had taken the poor man's dollar and the widow's
                mite, had repeatedly outraged his conscience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Catching a loose slab, he dealt a sudden blow on the
                head to Montcalm, who, staggering back, caught his legs
                on the saw-horse and fell. Green followed his advantage.
                He struck again with the slab, barely missing his aim;
                but as his weapon was clutched by the unknown burglar,
                he precipitated himself upon him. Montcalm whose
                movements were impeded by his thick jacket, succeeded
                in twisting from underneath his antagonist and regaining
                his feet. His mask, which had become unfastened, hung
                loose about his neck; and Green partly unnerved him by
                giving a yell of recognition and pressing with renewed
                vigor to the attack. Having a poor hold of his opponent,
                and being in every way at a disadvantage, he felt his
                strength begin to fail. As he was crowded close to the
                wall, his hand accidentally came in contact with the
                broad-ax. In despair he seized it and struck. The weapon
                seemed hardly to touch the man on whom it was turned,
                yet that touch was sufficient to send him toppling over,
                extinguishing the lantern in his fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cellar was in almost total darkness. The scanty
                light which came through the small windows, of which one
                was on the north side and one on the west, was lessened
                by screens and thick masses of overhanging vines,
                Montcalm threw aside the ax, groped hurriedly and found the
                pocket-book, with the intention of escaping before Green
                arose. But, as the seconds passed and there was no
                perceptible movement on the part of his late adversary, he
                felt that he need not anticipate immediate pursuit. He
                wondered that the stroke, which had but grazed the head
                of his opponent, should produce unconsciousness. An
                unconquerable desire seized him to learn what had been
                the result of the blow which he had delivered. The
                knowledge, however, could be at once gained only by an
                investigation, and from that investigation he shrank.
                While he was groping for his lantern, he heard a sound
                which filled him with an indescribable dread. It was the
                steady trickling of some liquid into the well. Never
                before had he been so nervous. He drew from his pocket
                a match, struck it against the wall, and dropped it ere his
                purpose had been served. With trembling fingers he
                took a second match and succeeded in igniting the wick
                of the lantern.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sudden transition from darkness to light at first
                dazzled his eyes. He saw barrels, the unhewn wall, the
                milk-shelves, and lastly a object which he had previously
                overlooked. Green was lying nearly lengthwise of a
                plank, which descended toward the well, and which had
                one end resting on the curb and the other on an elevated
                and hardened bed of water-lime. His head was on the
                edge of the plank and nearest the well. A portion of the
                trunk and one arm also was on this support, and the other
                upper limb was beyond it, while the remaining parts of
                the body rested on the ground. No wound was visible,
                but from some source a small stream of blood was passing
                down a depression in the center of the plank to the
                well, where it caused that trickling which had so wrought
                upon the nerves of Montcalm. The depredator, as he
                turned over the prostrate form, dreaded what his action
                might reveal, yet he was not prepared for such a spectacle
                as met his gaze. The upper portion of the right side of the
                forehead, including the skull and a thin section of brain,
                had been cleft and now hung suspended by a piece of
                skin. Laid bare by that destructive blow, the cerebrum
                showed its peculiar formation, though the convolutions of
                its exterior were partly disorganized by the leveling of the
                ridges. Much of the gray matter had been shaved from
                the surface of the cut, or crowded into the irregular
                furrows; so that, mingled with it, was the white from which
                the power of transmitting nervous force had been suddenly
                and unexpectedly wrested.
            </p>
            <p>
                A chill passed over Montcalm, which was not wholly a
                reaction from excessive heat generated by his physical
                struggle. But a few minutes before, and that cloven skull
                on which he was gazing had been the habitation of a living
                intellect, that amorphous mass of brain had been performing
                its normal functions; along those disfigured ridges
                had been passing thoughts, which, perhaps, related to self
                and self-aggrandizement, but which were those of a
                fellow-being. What though the reflections had been of a mean
                and penurious character? What though they had been on
                money and usury, on the oppression of the poor? The
                interruption of their existence was no human right, and
                woe to him by whom they were destroyed. Montcalm
                could scarcely believe that the pasty substance which
                riveted his attention was not even then the nursery of plans
                for revenge upon him, that sight had fled from the eyes,
                that the open mouth was not about to denounce him for
                his crime. The monotonous trickling into the well prolonged
                the spell which bound him, as a sameness of sound,
                by holding the external perceptives, sometimes prevents
                warning of the approach of deceit and prepares the way
                for the capture of the reflective faculties.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an effort he turned from the senseless body and
                started toward the outside door. As he did so, he
                stumbled over one of the rubber boots which he had
                knocked down in his descent to the cellar, and which had
                probably been long thrown aside by William Henry Harrison,
                for they were large and full of holes. It was instinct,
                instead of deliberative caution, which prompted him to
                draw on the boots and walk several times across a strip
                of sand, thus making it apparent that the murderer was a
                large man, or at least had large feet. The skilled
                depredator, who had mastered the details of his profession,
                and who habitually had them in readiness for his use, was
                actually passing from the scene of the murder, leaving
                behind him the lantern and the burglar tools, when he heard
                Mrs. Green call anxiously to her husband. That cry in
                a measure loosed him from his lethargy of mind. Gathering
                up his shoes, the tools and the lantern, he emerged
                from the cellar, and walking around to the front of the
                house, proceeded an eighth of a mile up the soft road to
                the southward, after which he continued his way on the
                grass. Then he climbed into a meadow lying between
                him and the wood which he had traversed in his approach
                to the house. A large, low stump was in his path, and
                on it he seated himself with no concern as to the
                advisability of his action.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was, indeed, strange conduct for one whose interest
                it unmistakably was to flee from a neighborhood which
                might at any moment become dangerous. Possibly the
                sound of pursuit might have roused him, might have led
                him to take measures for his safety; but it did not come,
                and listless and dejected, he kept his seat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intervention of the barns kept him from seeing the
                house, in which and in whose occupants alone he was
                interested. Crossing the lane and reaching the spot where
                he had made his exit from the wood, he was able to view
                Green's dwelling. A light was in the bedroom in which
                had slept the late master of the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                It soon passed from Montcalm's sight and reappeared
                from a window of the upright. Again it was lost to his
                view, and again it was visible as it entered the chamber
                and shone from the room of William Henry Harrison. It
                was plain that Mrs. Green was making a search for her
                husband, and probable that she would not abandon it
                until she found him in the cellar. Montcalm had no
                curiosity or inclination longer to stay so near the place
                where he had committed his felonious deed. So, picking
                up his bundle, which, as may be supposed, was indifferently
                arranged, he trudged slowly through the forest. And
                now, for the first time, he experienced a fear, which
                approached certainty, that his guilt would be detected.
                It was not the abject terror of the coward. It was the
                conviction of a brave man who was willing to struggle
                when there was hope, but who believed that he was
                menaced by odds which it was useless to resist.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the edge of the pond he halted. His mind, in that
                condition of vacillation which follows a severe shock to
                conscience, had veered from indifference, or rather stupor,
                to despairing expectation. In an indecisive conflict reason
                and imagination contended as to whether the monotonous
                night sounds were common and natural occurrences,
                or the ominous portents of coming evil. To him the
                croaking of the frogs, the low groaning and high wailing
                utterances of which came incessantly from the pond,
                seemed to be an arraignment against which he could made
                no defense.
            </p>
            <p>
                He removed his outer garments and put on in their
                places those which he had stored in the oak. There was
                no concealment which he considered safe for the
                appliances of burglary and the evidences of murder. Every
                location which he thought of had its disadvantages. The
                open fields were being plowed and cultivated, the woods
                were rambled through by hunters from Sharptown and
                Oakville, the swamp was nearly dry and was daily visited
                by berrying parties. Bringing his irresolution to an end, he
                put them all, the tools, disguise and clothing, including the
                lubber boots and his shoes, inside the tree. He placed his
                hand to his forehead. The touch was disagreeably harsh,
                for his palm was coated with dried and stiffened blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Passing over the verdureless circle to the deep hole where
                the remnant of the pond remained, Montcalm thrust his
                hand into the water, that the congealed life fluid might
                be soaked and detached. He applied also some of the
                roiled liquid to his forehead, forgetting that little more
                than a stone's-throw from him was a clear spring.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he left the pond, he reflected on the change which
                the night's events had wrought in is prospects. he had
                meant to abandon evil. While he was in his career of
                thieving and swindling, he had marked out his intended
                course. He would first accumulate a competence. Then
                he would marry some virtuous girl, between whom and
                himself existed a strong affection, and he would live a
                life of morality, even religion. Vanished was that dream
                of happiness. Judicious and good courtship requires
                serenity. How could he talk the language of love with such
                a secret weighing upon him, when every instant there
                posed before him a vision with cloven forehead and protruding
                brain? He had been engaged in wholesale trickery
                and theft, but blood he had avoided. And now it had
                smeared his clothing, his hands and, worst of all, his
                memory. An itching sensation was between the fingers of
                his right hand. Mechanically feeling with his left, he
                found a snake-like body, an extremity of which was
                imbedded in the skin. With a jump he threw from him a
                leech which must have become attached as he bathed in
                the pond. It was fully a minute before he realized by how
                trivial an object he had been frightened. Again he
                encountered the sheep, and again they fled before him. The
                act to which he had previously given no significance he
                now interpreted as an indication that the very brutes
                avoided his presence.

            </h2>

            <p>
                Ratke and Montcalm attended the inquest over the body
                of Josiah Green. Men were standing on the shady side
                of the house, on the two porches, and strolling about the
                yard. Justice Sparks had ordered the outside cellar door
                to be closed, that the body might not be tampered with
                before the official examination. The cellar would still
                have been easy of access had not Sparks nailed a board
                over the hole which had been cut by Montcalm, and which
                might have admitted a hand to lift the fastening hook.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you do, Major?" said a large, slightly corpulent
                man, with long chin whiskers, a rumbling voice and a breath
                which was tainted with whiskey.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you do, Dr. Rorus?" responded Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is a sad affair," observed the doctor, "a lamentable
                happening, a bad job. Terrible, terrible terrible," and
                Dr. Rorus raised his eyes aloft. "A man, a fellow-being,
                struck down, cut off in the very noontide, or, as you might
                say, meridian of vigor." At this point the physician took
                an uncertain step and waved his fist in the air.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major, whose own pomposity of language was unconsciously
                caricatured by Dr. Rorus, did not fancy listening
                to the drunken harangue, but he was obliged either
                to tolerate it or to beat a retreat. His friends had noticed
                that immediately after he had met the doctor he was less
                pedantic in his conversation, and his philosophical and
                historical allusions were less frequent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Have they found any trace of the assassin?" asked
                the major.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Strong evidence," responded the doctor, "very strong.
                There was a conspiracy. The victim was called up in
                the middle of the night and was never seen alive again.
                He was called by a certain individual that I won't name
                now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They will not convict William Henry Harrison on
                such proof," said Ratke. "I hope they have stronger
                evidence than that."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The murderer," said Rorus with his customary
                redundancy, "the homicide, the execrable monster, the
                villain will be punished and put in prison and made to
                suffer. With whom is he dealing? With you? No.
                With me? No. With a weak man? No. With that
                mighty aggregation, that great mass of power, the
                commonwealth and the State of Michigan. Oh, the people of
                Michigan are a wonderful people. They have developed
                and grown up to greatness. Plenty of hardship, plenty of
                enemies to fight. There is, or was when they grew up,
                the Indian, the bear, the wolf, the panther and the hard
                winters and--poverty and--hard labor, terrible hard
                and--the fever and--ague, the rattlesnake and--hardship.
                The Michigan boy has the enterprise. You can't beat
                him. Best in the world."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where is Sparks?" asked Ratke. "I would like to
                see him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can't say," said the doctor. "Where there's a slight
                breeze, there's a cause for it. Where there's a big wind,
                there's a good deal more. Evidence must have, has got
                to have, facts behind it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I understand," said the major. "We will talk this
                over some other time."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There is no denying the fact. Major," declared Rorus,
                detaining Ratke by clutching his sleeve. "Brace against
                it and it will push you back. Try to shove it along and
                it will kick. I will give my drug-store, and my practice,
                and my diploma to any scholar, or set of scholars, who
                will disprove what I say, or demonstrate that it isn't so,
                either one, mind you, either one. There is a chance for
                somebody, a big chance."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Precisely," acknowledged the major, glancing uneasily
                about, but disliking rudely to leave his tiresome
                companion.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I claim," said Rorus, "I assert positively, without a
                tinge of doubt,there was no profit in that deed, that
                atrocity, as you might term it if you was disposed to give it
                a hard name. Oh, I don't believe in being mealy-mouthed
                with these rascals. In the first place there was no profit
                to the killer, the murderer I mean, to be more explicit.
                He will go to some saloon, and he'll drink. Then he'll
                gamble, and he'll lose what he's got, and he'll fight. And
                of course, as he's drunk, he'll get whipped and get a black
                eye. So you will admit. Major, there is no profit in a
                black eye. I claim, and I defy any man to prove to the
                contrary, aye, I challenge the world, there was no profit
                in it to Green. If there was, where was it? There was
                the house broken into. There was the $2,000 gone."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Exactly," remarked the major with a sigh.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Morality pays," pursued the doctor. "That is the
                teaching of the greatest philosophers, and thinkers, and
                orators, and smart men of the present day, and of the
                past, and that ever lived, of Aristotle, and Epictetus, and
                Bacon, and Socrates, and Pluto. Oh, that Pluto was a
                wonderful man. His philosophy is mild--and gentle--and
                beneficent and pleasant."
            </p>
            <p>
                "If ever you fall into his dominion," observed Ratke,
                "you will find it not a pleasant one."
            </p>
            <p>
                At this juncture, to the major's joy, he was approached
                by Sparks and informed that his testimony would be required,
                and that the jury, the witnesses and the officers of
                the inquest were to go through the house and view the
                cellar before the outside door was opened for the
                admission of the crowd. Sparks carried a lighted lamp in
                order to help their observations.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here are his tracks plain enough," said Holmes.
                "He wore rubber boots."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I tracked him down south in the sand as much as
                forty rods," said the sheriff, whose unpretentious manner
                up to this time had concealed his interest in the tragedy.
                "Then he went to one side. There was a ways where the
                grass looked as if it had been disturbed. After that I
                couldn't follow him at all."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's queer he should go in the sand," commented the
                prosecuting attorney, a sleek young man who had red
                cheeks which were evidently made so by dissipation.
                "He ought to know he could be followed there."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Murderers don't think of such things," said the sheriff.
                "They're generally in a hurry. It's some little thing that
                they forget that gets them caught. I wonder what size
                those rubber boots were. We can measure the tracks.
                Who's got a rule?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The cellar door was now opened, and those who were
                waiting entered. The jury with Rorus surrounded the
                body and drew from it the sheet by which it had been
                covered.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a copy of the statutes in his hand Sparks
                administered the oath to the six jurors.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here is what done it," said the justice, picking up the
                broad-ax after he had performed the official duty just
                mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Terrible blow," ejaculated Dr. Rorus, "terrible.
                Crashed through the cuticle, the cutis, the frontal bone,
                the parietal bone, the arachnoid, the dura mater, the pia
                mater and the cerebrum. Intelligence, in a moment,
                in a second, in a half of a second, or less, for it was done
                instantly, destroyed, stopped, or, more properly, used
                up. Did you ever think what a slippery thing mind is.
                Major? Intangible, incomprehensible. You can't get at
                it. You want to put it under a microscope, but it isn't
                there. You grab for it, but it gets away. Whenever
                you put your hand on it, it slips out just like a greased
                pig."
            </p>
            <p>
                So eager were the spectators to view the proceedings of
                the inquest that they seriously embarrassed the jurors in
                their deliberations and crowded them almost upon the
                body of Green. The annoyance at last aroused the displeasure
                of Sparks, who ordered two constables to clear a
                larger place for the accommodation of the court. The retreat
                was slow, like all forced backward movements of a
                crowd. Those who were behind had no inclination to
                move farther away from the object of interest, and those
                who were in front were by them prevented from doing so.
                Finally motion was imparted to the sluggish mass, which,
                reaching beyond the door, settled back with the rearward
                part resisting the retrogression. One of the lookers-on, who
                struggled most obstinately against yielding his position,
                was crowded toward the door; his heels struck the barrel
                which served as a curb, and he was precipitated to a sitting
                posture. Unfortunately for him he was a lean man,
                so very lean, that, doubled up as he was, he shot inside of
                the barrel, where, helpless and clamorous, he remained
                with his chin barely above water and the soles of his feet
                and the top of his head forming equally elevated slopes.
                The excited throng pressed about him and drove him farther
                into the well, but he was finally rescued, and the
                investigation proceeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the dead body had been critically examined, it
                was wrapped in the sheet and removed to the ground
                floor. Sparks led the way to the room directly above the
                cellar, where the testimony was to be taken.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Gentlemen," said Sparks, "we've met to-day to do our
                duty, and that's what everybody orto be willin' to do.
                One of our neighbors has been slayed almost before our
                eyes. Now we want to find out who done it, and what he
                done it for. Folks'll expect it of us, consequently that's
                what we orto do."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sparks now proceeded to the examination of witnesses.
                Dr. Rorus gave straggling testimony relating to the organs
                affected by the wound, to the time and to the immediate
                cause of death. It was to no purpose that the sheriff and
                the prosecuting attorney bade him confine his attention to
                necessary facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke was the next witness to be called. The preceding
                day he had paid Green fourteen thousand five hundred
                forty-two dollars and forty-two cents. All except the
                forty-two cents was in paper. He had given paper because
                it was the cheaper currency and it was what he had
                borrowed. After he had paid him, Green drove toward
                home, and that was the last time he had seen him alive.
                When asked by the prosecuting attorney whether there
                had been any ill-feeling between him and the deceased, he
                admitted that there had been. When questioned as to its
                nature, he said substantially that, as his neighbor was dead,
                he could not with propriety explain their trouble. He
                was liable to prejudice. The account which he would furnish
                might be biased. A counter-statement from the other
                party, therefore, would be necessary to give the jury a
                correct idea of the circumstances. That statement it was
                impossible to obtain. He, consequently, must be silent
                respecting their relations. He could only inform them
                that, however intense or unjust his animosity, it never would
                have prompted him to injure in person, reputation or
                finance the victim of the recent tragedy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs, Green was nearly overcome by grief, and the jury
                allowed her to tell her story without being subjected to
                many questions. She was quite deaf. She had been
                awakened by her husband in the night. Green said
                William Henry Harrison wanted him to come upstairs,
                and she, herself, could hear the calls, though she could not
                understand them. From her husband she learned their
                import. William Henry Harrison said that he was sick.
                Then he said that he was very sick and that he was going
                to die. Next he said that he was going to have a fit and that
                he would break the house. He broke the bed, knocked
                out some window lights and jarred loose a lot of plaster.
                Green at last went up to see what was the matter. She
                waited for him a long time, but he did not come. After
                a while she became alarmed and ascended to the chamber.
                William Henry Harrison acted strangely. She asked him
                where her husband was, but he returned an answer so low
                that she could not hear him. She thought it was a whisper.
                She insisted that he should speak, and he was still
                obstinate. She tried to pull him from bed, but she
                was not strong enough. Then she endeavored to haul the
                clothes from him. At that he resisted and even acted
                mad. She never saw him so violent before. Whenever
                she moved the quilt which was over him, he carefully
                replaced it again. He would fold it and put it over his legs,
                and she saw him arrange it so that a wrinkle would run
                across the center. As she continued her attempts to
                arouse him, he grew frantic, and she was afraid longer to
                stay by him. After hunting through the house she went
                down cellar and found her husband. She could not tell
                what she did during the next few minutes, but she was
                sure she did not touch the body. When she recovered
                from the shock sufficiently to think and act, she proceeded
                to Mr. Holmes's house and awakened him. He, with
                another neighbor whom he aroused, came home with her,
                and watched in the cellar until morning.

                "The next witness I shall perceed to call," said the
                justice, "is William Henry Harrison Hibbard."
            </p>
            <p>
                Gently pushed forward by several men, William Henry
                Harrison took the chair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sparks gravely looked down at the law-book and
                repeated these words: "William Henry Harrison Hibbard,
                you do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give to
                this inquest concernin' the death of the person here
                lyin' dead shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothin'
                but the truth."
            </p>
            <p>
                The half-wit stared stupidly at the justice, but made no
                reply.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The court is waitin'," observed Sparks. "We want
                you to speak up."
            </p>
            <p>
                Still the witness did not answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're in a hurry," said Sparks. "Do you swear it,
                I say?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," replied William Henry Harrison.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What!" ejaculated Sparks, "you won't tell us? Now
                I ask you again. Do you swear to tell the truth?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said William Henry Harrison, "I no swear.
                Wicked, awful."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We do not want you to swear or say anything bad,"
                said the major. "We want to know if you will tell the
                truth."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," was the response. "I no lie."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, William Henry Harrison Hibbard," Sparks
                began, "we want you to tell us somethin' about the
                murder. Some think you know more about it than you
                care to tell. They kind o' think you know who it was
                that hit 'im."
            </p>
            <p>
                William Henry Harrison's terror of the preceding night
                was revived. He remembered the dark-lantern, the hideous
                face which had peered into his, the great shadow
                which had been thrown on the ceiling and the threats
                which the ferocious intruder had uttered. He drew down
                his head and shoulders and cast an uneasy glance toward
                the door which led to the cellar.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want to ask you, William Henry Harrison," said
                Sparks, "what did you do as you did for? What did you
                want to call Mr. Green up there for when you knowed
                somebody was a-waitin' to kill 'im? There was nothin'
                fair about that. It wa'n't as you'd like to be done by.
                Answer me now. What did you want to do it for?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Poor William Henry Harrison, incapable of defense,
                could only stare in mute appeal.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you don't answer me," threatened Sparks, "I shall
                take legal perceedin's agin you. What did you want to
                do it for?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I dono," responded the half-wit.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, you do know, too," persisted Sparks. "If you
                called him up there, you know what you called him for,
                You orto be ashamed o' yourself, a-doin' like that. There
                he'd fed you an' kept you an' give you your clothes, an'
                you had to up an' play that mean trick on 'im,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Young man," said Dr. Rorus, in his most resonant
                bass, "do you realize the position you are taking?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The prosecuting attorney here objected to Rorus's
                questioning the witness.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you know," persisted the drunken doctor, ignoring
                the objection, "that you are in insurrection against,
                aye, assaulting the statutes of the Peninsular State?
                For, when you stand in the way of justice, you are
                assailing the whole. Do you think the people will stand
                that? Why, my dear sir, you never heard the motto of Michigan,
                did you? It is 'Tuebor'--I will defend her. And, when
                the young men of Michigan say, 'I will defend her,' they
                mean it. They are ready to fight for her liberty and her
                rights and her civilization. At the first menace they would
                crowd up by the dozens and the hundreds and the thousands
                and the millions. Now answer instantly."
            </p>
            <p>
                The frightened witness slid to the side of his chair as
                far from his interlocutor as he could get without leaving
                or moving his seat. The prosecuting attorney again
                protested that Rorus had no right to question the witness.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Rules are for use, sir," said the doctor--"for use when
                they're needed. We don't need that rule now. Young
                man," he continued, addressing William Henry Harrison,
                "you are liable to be arrested for conspiracy, to be put
                in Jackson inside of stone walls, and have men ready to
                shoot you if you try to run away. I will have a man
                come for you now. Your honor, send a constable for
                him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Rorus," interrupted the major, "you are drunk or you
                are a fool. Your honor, if you will allow me to question
                the witness, I think I can extract the information you
                want. Now, William Henry Harrison," he said, turning
                to the half-wit, "I will let none of them hurt you. I will
                keep them off. You like tobacco, don't you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No like now. No like nothin' now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "But you will like it when we go away," said Ratke
                kindly, "Jim, let me lake your tobacco box."
            </p>
            <p>
                The young fellow who at the hunt after the horse
                thieves had been conspicuous in the white hat handed
                Ratke his tobacco box. William Henry Harrison, whose
                scanty supply of tobacco had been partly stolen from
                Green and partly bought by pennies which he had
                accumulated, took the box and hesitated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You had better take it," said Ratke. "You may not
                have another chance to get tobacco."
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus urged, the half-wit transferred the tobacco to his
                pocket.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you will answer a few questions," said the major,
                "you can leave us and be away from these men. Then,
                when I go to Break o'Day, I will buy you a pound of
                tobacco. Now, I would like to, know if any one came to
                your room last night."
            </p>
            <p>
                The allusion to the circumstances by which the half-wit
                had been so frightened again made him incapable of
                utterance. His terrified looks and shrinking posture
                indicated that he would give no evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, you aught not to be afraid," said Ratke, "I
                won't let anybody touch you. What kind of looking man
                was he?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "He big. He awful."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There," exclaimed Sparks, "now we've got a clue.
                If you can git him to tell who he looks like. Major, it'll be
                a big point."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Holmes," said the major, "hand me your tobacco
                box. Have a chew, William Henry Harrison. Did the
                man have whiskers?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," responded William Henry Harrison. "He
                have whissers, just like Misser Sparks."
            </p>
            <p>
                This unexpected reply drew the general attention to
                the justice and brought a flush to the judicial countenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell me what he did," said Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said William Harrison. "He say he kill when I
                tell."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let him come," said Ratke assuringly. "I will give
                him the hardest thrashing he ever got. You don't think
                he will hurt you when I am here, do you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I 'fraid of no one when you here. He come when
                you go 'way. Come when nobody here. Night. He
                shoot, kill, hurt, make blood."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you know he will hurt you?" asked the
                major.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He say so. He come las' night. He pull my legs.
                He say I call Misser Green. I say I no like call Misser
                Green. He git mad. Then he say he hurt I no call
                Misser Green. He shake me. I call Misser Green.
                Misser Green git mad. Man he make me say I sick, I
                have fit. I break things. Misser Green he git mad.
                He come up. Man he lay quilt on my legs. He say I
                move quilt he kill me. Man he scare Misser Green.
                Misser Green he go with man. Miss Green she come up.
                She pull quilt. I 'fraid man come. I pull. I 'fraid
                now"
            </p>
            <p>
                "That will do, William Henry Harrison," said the
                major. "You have been a good witness. You must admit,
                Rorus, that he has told a not improbable story. It is not
                strange that he should be compelled to do as he did by
                the assassin, who was certain that the course Which he
                adopted would bring Mr. Green to the chamber. Besides,
                William Henry Harrison is not capable of inventing
                the account which he gave."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We've heerd all the testimony we can git at," said
                Sparks, "that is, so far as we know. Now, honorable
                jury, I want you to decide this question. An', while
                you're about it, git it right if you can. This lookin' a
                thing over an' then gittin' it wrong after you've had the
                fussin', I don't think much of."
            </p>
            <p>
                The clerk, with the help of Dr. Rorus, prepared the
                inquisition, to which the jury subscribed. The document
                stated that "The said Josiah Green came to his death between
                the hours of one and two o'clock, on the second
                day of July, 187--, in the cellar of his own house, by means
                of a broad-ax, in the hands of a person or of persons
                unknown, and that the immediate cause of death was
                cerebral hemorrhage inducing paralysis of the nerve
                centers, asphyxia, cerevuesisms and coma."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Green's neighbors eradicated the traces of the
                murder from the cellar. The broad-ax they gave to
                Sparks. Back of the barn they carried the plank, with its
                discoloring stripe of dark red. They dipped dry the
                well, the water of which was bloody and loathsome as that
                of the Egyptian streams over which Aaron's rod was
                stretched. It could never again be used, for though it
                would once more be clear, the sickening thought of the
                tragedy which had given it that crimson tinge would
                appall him who should presume to drink from it. William
                Henry Harrison was obliged to carry the family supply of
                water from the barn until another well could be dug.

                "Trace," observed the major, after they had passed the
                church on their return to the farm, "you remind me more
                and more of your father. When there was a general
                struggle to obtain a petty object, he never joined the
                rabble. He was willing that others should go before him.
                At Green's you sacrificed your curiosity to the curiosity of
                others. You might have crowded up and viewed the body,
                but you did not. I do not believe you went into the
                cellar to-day."

                <small>MONTCALM FINDS DANTE INACCURATE.</small>
            </h2>

            <p>
                On the second night after the inquest Montcalm fell
                into his first slumber since the nocturnal expedition which
                had robbed him of Nature's restorative and had deprived
                Green of mortal existence. In that state in which the
                reasoning faculties are yielding to the need of rest, the
                gradual transition from balanced consciousness to uncertain
                fancy, he thought he saw a broad, smoothly flowing
                river. The green meadow beside it, the adjacent woods,
                where huge trees seemed ineffectually striving to form
                bridges, were familiar to him. The house in which he was
                born he saw for an instant before its place was occupied
                by other objects. A cool breeze came from the water,
                bringing to him vigor and placidity. He had a
                strange sensation, yet it was one of peace. He was that
                river. In his way were no greater trials than the fallen
                trees which he swept around without inconvenience from
                their presence or animosity for their interference.
            </p>
            <p>
                His being was now divided, but the division was unequal.
                A certain amount of perception alone, stripped
                of the power of action, separated from the river. Through
                this perception the dreamer continued his fancies. He
                could no longer see the river, which retained his capacity
                for good or evil, his moral responsibility. Gradually the
                stream narrowed and became more turbulent. This was
                indicated by the roar of its waters, which, continually
                rising in pitch, betokened the decline of power and the
                increase of violence. The cataract, for such it had grown
                to be, was now as small as that which falls over a
                schoolboy's dam. Still it decreased in size until it was no
                larger than an ordinary hand, and soon its water could
                have been drained as fast as it fell by a thirsty man.
                Montcalm started as the stream underwent its last
                diminution. Once before he had heard that measured
                trickling. Some time elapsed ere he could turn his head
                and view the remains of that river, which had parted with
                strength, beauty and serenity. At last he saw the dropping
                liquid, but it was not water. It was falling from the
                end of a plank into a well with a barrel curb. On the
                plank was the source of the stream, the form of a man
                with skull cloven and with brain exposed. The frightful
                wound, which was presented toward Montcalm, showed
                him that the victim was still cognizant of current events,
                for shadows of thought were passing along the convolutions
                of the cerebrum. The shadows, or waves, had no
                regularity of form or of appearance. At times they moved
                slowly, at others they passed with great rapidity, like the
                spokes of a swiftly revolving wheel. The eyes were fixed
                and lurid, but they were frequently darkened by clouds of
                meaning, the shades which were sweeping along the brain.
                The face, undergoing the not unusual exaggeration of
                dreams, alternately lengthened and broadened, one dimension
                reaching its maximum development as the other
                attained its minimum. The sleeper believed its hue was
                ghastlier than that of death. He reached the climax of
                his fright when the dead man, by a convulsive effort,
                changed his features to the aspect of life and fastened on
                him a look such as he might have given a poor neighbor
                on whose meager possessions he had a mortgage which
                he meant relentlessly to foreclose. He knew that Green
                never gave that wink and leer except when some cherished
                project of vengeance or finance was materializing to
                a certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The repulsive object on the plank was once more
                hideously distorted. As the chin dropped in an abnormal
                distension, the mouth opened and seemed about to close
                on Montcalm, who inert and helpless, dreaded the first
                touch of the jagged lips. From the cavernous throat deformed
                beings beckoned to him to join them. What heightened
                his fear was a mad impulse to precipitate himself
                into the yawning chasm, an act which he knew would
                be followed by the most appalling consequences. Strenuously
                he tried to escape. Not a muscle would contract
                to help him in his emergency. Finally his will-power
                prevailed and he was able to flee. Leaving the cellar, he
                entered the apartment on the ground floor. Instantly
                from the vicinity of the well came the clamor of pursuit,
                and after him sprang a dozen men. He was in a very
                large house which he was determined to quit, but every
                door which he opened disclosed to him a division of the
                infinitely vast building. He raced from room to room,
                from each of which, sustaining a sharp conflict, he emerged,
                invariably frightened and invariably unhurt. His desperate
                defense was not prompted by courage, for he had but one desire,
                that of finding safety at whatever cost.
                His adversaries, on the contrary, though often driven back
                had stricken down, returned each time to the attack, not in
                the least dismayed by the blows which they had received.
                Presently they forced him to a corner from which he
                could not retreat. His guard was beaten down, and he
                was at the mercy of his pitiless enemies. They surrounded him,
                raising high their bludgeons, which poised
                an instant before descending.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a gigantic leap he crashed through the wall and trod
                the solid earth. Given on this footing an unnatural speed,
                he swept over fields, fences and woods, barely treading
                the ground and propelling himself far at every light touch
                of his foot. No longer were his pursuers in sight or hearing,
                but fearful of the approach, he would not abate his
                exertions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before him was the great swamp, and his route was the
                causeway east of Ratke's. He was almost flying along the
                road, by the side of which the tamaracks grew large and
                tall, when to his inexpressible horror Archer arose from
                the bushes, pointed a revolver at him and fired. The
                shot at once robbed him of his great speed, and in his
                face blew a strong wind against which he could make
                little headway. His pursuers again drew new. With
                savage gesticulations and yells of triumph the pressed
                about him. In the intensity of despair he felt that he
                could neither flee nor fight. Helplessly he looked aloft
                and prayed for relief. As with limbs paralyzed, but with
                senses painfully acute, he lay momentarily expecting
                destruction, an angelic form flitted to his rescue, and
                interposing its bright wings, parried the threatening clubs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mien of the angel was benign and serene. Merciful
                in his strength, he did not injure those who were endeavoring
                to kill the wretch who had secured his intervention.
                Montcalm, confident in the will and ability of this being
                to protect him, imploringly clutched the hem of his garment.
                The angel stooped and lifted him; and together,
                propelled by those bright wings, hand in hand, they sped
                away at a rate which defied pursuit. Their course was
                midway between the horizontal and the vertical. Terrestrial
                objects, trees, rivers, hills and plains, blended
                indistinguishably together on the surface of the
                disappearing planet, which, a non-luminous ball, was
                drawing its dusky outlines into smaller compass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Measureless was the space through which they flew.
                Montcalm became aware that his feet now and then met a
                substance which, though not solid, was more tangible than
                air. His footing grew firmer. He was entering a land
                where the common objects of inhabited earth were wanting,
                where irregularly formed bodies cast shadows along
                the uneven surface. A dull red glare, hovering over a
                strip of the horizon, gave a quantity of light insufficient
                to make vision plain. He drew closer to his protector,
                for he was intimidated by the unfamiliar sight. Journeying
                on, they came to a locality which was entirely occupied
                by somber rocks piled in mountain-like masses by
                convulsions of the sub-strata. In the distance a lurid
                flame shot up high in the heavens, as if the forces which
                had wrought that devastation, instead of dying out, had
                shifted in position and increased in intensity.
                Awe-stricken, Montcalm paused. Gladly would he have
                returned to the world from which he had fled; but, as he
                attempted to escape from his companion, his hand was
                tightly held, and he was unable to withdraw it. At the
                same moment the strange being underwent a transformation.
                His golden wings lost their brilliancy, from the
                top of his head sprang great horns, his face changed from
                benignity to diabolical ugliness and was dark and stern
                as the fire-blackened rocks around him. Agonized beyond
                measure, Montcalm gazed on him who destroys men's
                souls, and he remembered that he had voluntarily placed
                himself in his power. While he was shrinking from his
                repulsive master and fearfully awaiting the awful flame
                which had now neared him, he heard, repeated, a long
                shrill blast, the annunciation that "there should be time
                no longer."
            </p>
            <p>
                He opened his eyes as the notes of one of the major's
                chanticleers was dying away. It was some minutes before
                he comprehended the unreality of his dream, and even
                after it was apparent to him, he frequently wondered if it
                were really a delusion. Day had not yet arrived. The
                light which came through the evergreens in front of his
                window was furnished chiefly by the moon, which had
                more than an hour ere its supersedure by the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plaster on the walls had cracked, leaving many
                seams which an unemployed imagination might construe
                to represent definite shapes. Montcalm's gaze followed
                one of these lines as, making a number of curves, it formed
                a grotesque resemblance to a man's head. Uneasily he
                turned toward the opposite wall, fancying that the picture
                was shaped like the exaggerated countenance of Green as
                it had appeared in his dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                No sooner had he sought relief by changing his posture
                than his eyes fell on another set of seams which united in
                the shape of a broad-ax. He sprang from bed resolved
                that he would not longer stay where the most commonplace
                things united to make his sojourn hideous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weakened by the horrors of the night, he walked slowly
                from the house. The cattle were lying down in the
                barnyard. With the exception of himself and Mrs. Grippin's
                ducks neither animals nor men were astir about the place.
                Wearily he opened a barn door and climbing a stationary
                ladder, flung himself on the haymow. Sleep was for him
                impossible, but he might be able to rest. He did, indeed,
                find a partial refuge from his harrowing thoughts. But,
                as the day dawned, he was beset by a swarm of flies,
                which would give him no peace. When he had covered
                his face with his hat, they lighted on his hands, and when
                he had plunged his bands into the hay, they crowded under
                the hat and still tormented him. He believed that
                henceforth for him there was no quiet; that all nature had
                conspired to make him miserable.
                He heard the me chatting in the stable and about the
                barnyard. Not wishing to be discovered in the loft, he
                climbed down and was passing out, when he met Archer,
                whose inexpressive face reminded him of the shot which
                had stopped his flight in the swamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breakfast was to him a severe trial. By dint of great
                exertion he managed to invent a few gay remarks and to
                deliver them in a sprightly manner; but the effort was so
                severe that it could not be prolonged, and he relapsed
                again into silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a fine Sabbath morning, and after his few chores
                were done, he sauntered back of the house, where he was
                joined by Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The murder, has drawn my attention from my own
                affairs," said the major. "I am again financially
                embarrassed. Did I tell you about it, Trace?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, you did not," answered Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I do not want to profane the Sabbath, but this is not
                a business matter," said Ratke, feeling in spite of his
                explanation that he was doing what he pretended to avoid,
                "that is, it is not a transaction in business to-day.
                Durgenson has written me that he must have $4,000 the 23d
                of this month. I have nothing for him unless I sell the
                Barton hundred and sixty. What would you do?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do not pay him one cent," replied Montcalm, with an
                energy which he had not exhibited for days. "He wants
                to get your entire property. Let him have this farm, but
                keep---
            </p>
            <p>
                "What!" exclaimed the major, "let the place go without
                an attempt to save it ? Do you know how I have become
                attached to my home? To save it, I will sacrifice,
                if need be, all my possessions."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is what you will do," rejoined Montcalm, "and
                it will avail you nothing. If you do not pay your
                indebtedness on the day it is due, the farm belongs to
                Durgenson. Pay all you owe him, if you pay anything. He
                does not want it paid. He is longing to get every dollar
                you have. He would be disappointed to hear that you
                were prepared to discharge the debt. The shark in whose
                clutches you have fallen will show you no mercy until the
                shark of the sea returns a man unharmed to the deck of
                the vessel from which he has fallen."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have a new opinion of Durgenson," said the
                major. "You were the first one to advise me to take the
                step which I did."
            </p>
            <p>
                "God forgive me, I did!" exclaimed Montcalm bitterly.
                "But all is not ruined now. You have a hundred and
                sixty acres of good land. That will keep you well, and
                you need not do a stroke of work. Suppose you let that
                go and are penniless, what will you do? You ought not
                to be obliged to labor at your age. I would keep it by
                all means."
            </p>
            <p>
                Montcalm purposely strolled near a group of the hired
                men, and Ratke, unable to impart confidences, returned to
                the house. Had the gloomy young man been questioned
                by one who had authority to demand an answer, he could
                not have explained why he went down the road toward
                the church and plunged into the wood at the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was with dread that he approached the pond. Its
                edge had retreated farther from its usual border than it
                was on the night when he had last visited it. Some turtles
                which were on a log fell with splashes into the water.
                A snake swam a rod or two from shore and dived for
                safety. Montcalm's hair arose as he saw a leech on the
                muddy bottom worming its way to shore. Sick with aversion,
                he turned away, believing that the pond and its
                vicinity was fit only for the habitation of devils. He
                put his hand inside the hollow tree and drew out the
                articles which he had there hidden. They were as he had
                left them, the plunder, the auger, the mask and the rough
                clothes with their blood-stains. He was not actuated by
                a love of his ill-acquired money, and he had little curiosity.
                Indeed, he did not open the pocket-book, and he barely
                glanced at the clothes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Restoring to the tree what he had removed, he walked
                toward the swamp. In the gradual descent he found a
                spring, and stooping, he took a cool draught and from it
                bathed his face and head. After being thus invigorated,
                he resumed his walk in better spirits. From the side of
                the declivity bubbled other springs, the water of which met
                in a rivulet, which joined the creek in the tamaracks,
            </p>
            <p>
                Montcalm sat down near a fallen tree-top which partly
                obstructed the brook. The limbs reached nearly across
                the channel; so that the water, sweeping by at one side,
                made its escape through a narrow passage. The current
                below was rapid. Above it moved slowly, halting at the
                tree-top where a partial dam of leaves, sticks and scum
                was collected. Long strings of green slime swayed to
                and fro, attached to the bottom and the sides of the
                channel. Whirled above by the eddies, small objects were
                passed into a peaceful bay formed by the tree-top and
                the bank or swept into the turbulent rapids beyond.
                Montcalm became impressed with the idea that the placid
                bay held safety and that in the rapid current beyond was
                destruction. Every piece of bark which was brought by
                the rivulet he watched to ascertain its fate. He was glad
                when one reached the smooth haven, disappointed when
                another swept around the obstruction and was hurried to
                its doom. By degrees he came to regard each floating
                substance as a representation of himself, his deeds, his
                chance of preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                An ant crawled down an overhanging bush which almost
                touched the surface of the brook. Ordinarily it
                would have maintained its balance, but as it whirled to
                ascend, struck by a puff of wind, it fell. Montcalm viewed
                its struggles with interest, for it reminded him of the
                manner in which he, tossed hither and thither, had been
                borne down the stream of fatality. He reflected that he
                could no more have resisted the temptations and
                circumstances by which he was surrounded than the poor
                insect could rise above the whirlpools and fly to land. And
                yet, the ant was in a measure responsible for its misfortune.
                It had realized the danger and hovered over it, believing
                that its vigilance was sufficient protection. He had known
                where flowed the river into which he had leaped, but he
                had thought that he could leave it before arriving at the
                fatal rapids, from which there could be no extrication.
                Not far from him was the cataract which descended to the
                abyss of eternal woe, its sheet of falling water, its
                projecting rocks, its appalling roar. If the ant passed into
                the still haven, he would believe that he might likewise
                escape. If, swept on by the angry waves, it perished, he
                would have no prospect of avoiding a .similar fate.
                Anxiously he awaited the result on which in a spirit of fatalism
                he had based his hopes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ant, struggling, floated toward the rapids. The
                movement, however, was not decisive, and it swam nearer
                to the shelter of the right bank, where it lay hesitating
                between the shore and the stream. It again circled, and
                entering the current, was carried toward the point of a
                limb which separated the still and the agitated waters.
                Poised an instant in mock deliberation, it was hurled into
                the rushing waves. Montcalm was seized with a resolve
                to rescue the creature. He ran to a stick, which he
                clutched. When he turned to the brook, the ant had
                disappeared. He bent over the spot where he had last seen
                it, he rushed down the stream, he splashed the water with
                the stick. Not a trace could he find of the insect whose
                fate he had identified with his own.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why, what are you trying to do?" said a voice, at
                the sound of which he started in alarm, "dragging the
                river for a dead body?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The speaker was Durgenson, who was spending Sunday
                with Sparks and who had approached, unobserved,
                during Montcalm's preoccupation. He wore a wide-brimmed
                straw hat and a suit of plaid clothes, with a sack
                coat which fitted tightly his full muscular figure. "You
                don't look well," he continued, without waiting for a reply
                to his question. "Ratke isn't in the habit of working
                his hands hard enough to hurt them."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said Montcalm, "I am not overworked. I have
                been awake a great deal nights. I think I will leave the
                locality soon. I want sleep and a change of scene."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is what you ought to have," remarked Durgenson.
                "You have worked harder than people have any
                idea of. Now, I'll bet something handsome you can tell
                who hit old Green."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you any better than I, you swindler?" retorted
                Montcalm. "You have tricked honest men of small
                means, from whom I would have been ashamed to take a
                dollar. I once owned a conscience, but you never had
                one."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, there's no use getting in a pet, Trace," responded
                Durgenson good-naturedly. "I didn't mean anything.
                I've come to bring you some money. That ought to put
                you in better humor. Suppose we settle to-day."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have long been wanting a settlement," replied
                Montcalm. "How much did the last horses bring?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "The last I sold were the ones they had such a hunt
                for," said Durgenson. "They brought four hundred
                dollars."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Four hundred dollars!" ejaculated Montcalm in surprise.
                "Madge T. alone ought to have sold for more than that!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't help that," returned Durgenson. "You can't
                take advantage of the market where you are dealing in
                such property. You have to dispose of it the best way
                you can. Here is two hundred dollars. That makes us
                square, don't it?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," responded Montcalm, "you owe me a great deal
                more. I have done the planning for your enterprises and
                you have reaped the benefits. When I told you of the
                oat scheme, you agreed to pay me well for the time I
                spent. I worked at it until I had it perfected. You
                made thousands of dollars from it. Where is my share?
                I laid the plan of the Guerrero Mining Company and
                studied weeks to perfect it. Excepting the one share
                which I sold, what has it availed me?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, now, that hasn't panned out much yet," said
                Durgenson. "I expect it will pay."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There is one matter I would like to speak about,"
                said Montcalm. "I have made but few requests to you,
                and you ought to be willing to grant this one. You have
                Major Ratke's farm in your possession. You are now
                trying to get the proceeds from the Barton hundred and
                sixty. Take the old farm if you will, but let him have
                that fragment of his estate. I ask it as a personal favor,
                Durgenson."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, that is asking a great deal," remarked Durgenson.
                "You want me to let him go after he is once in my
                hand. You helped to catch him yourself."
            </p>
            <p>
                "So I did," replied Montcalm," and I have a right to
                insist that part of my wishes concerning him shall be
                carried out. I have hated myself ever since I entrapped
                him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll see about it," said Durgenson. "Say how much
                you want a day for your work."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fifteen dollars," answered Montcalm, "and I put in,
                call it ten days."
            </p>
            <p>
                "All right," said Durgenson, "That is satisfactory,
                I'll make it two hundred, and then you'll be satisfied.
                The oat business, though, was profitable. It was well
                got up, too. The name was worth a fortune. If it had
                been Chinese or Russian, the farmers might not have bit,
                but Nijni Novgorod, they couldn't stand that. I suppose
                you've no objection to getting a thousand more?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you want done?" inquired Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You see," answered Durgenson, "there's a fellow I
                don't like the looks of, not that he's homelier than other
                folks, but he don't look good to me. Now, I want that
                fellow got out of my sight, out of everybody's sight."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you take me for, you scoundrel?" exclaimed
                Montcalm, "a cutthroat? I am bad enough, but I will
                not kill a man for hire."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why, you are getting conscientious," sneered Durgenson.
                "You never used to have any such compunctions.
                There's a man in the graveyard that would have been
                walking around if it hadn't been for you. When did you
                get virtuous?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you the one to twit me of vice?" angrily cried
                Montcalm. "You have encouraged me in it and fattened
                on my misdeeds. When I first knew you, I was an innocent
                boy, determined to make an honest man, I had no
                more thought of becoming what I am than you have of
                giving your property to a benevolent institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                "My father died, my mother was in poor circumstances,
                and I was obliged to work in order that I might finish my
                college course. You hired me at first to bring cattle to the
                east. You made great professions of honesty and of concern
                for the welfare of others. In this way you won my
                confidence. Then you convinced me it was right to run a
                saloon, that if we did not some one else would and the
                liquor would still be drunk. From selling whisky, you
                lured me to swindling. You told me that every man
                must look out for himself, that honesty is the cant of
                hypocrites or the practice of fools, that the only wisdom is
                in looking to self-gain regardless of right or wrong.
                When you had schooled me well in swindling, you drilled
                me in horse-stealing, awarding me the danger and you the
                profit. I tell you, Durgenson, I am going straight to hell
                and it is you who have sent me. I said I was going to
                hell. I have been there. I am there now, and I can
                hardly restrain myself from pulling you in after me."
            </p>
            <p>
                Durgenson started back, appalled by the terrific aspect
                of Montcalm, whose hand was raised aloft, whose face
                was deadly pale, and whose eyes were blazing almost
                with the fire of lunacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold on!" expostulated the cattle-buyer. "Don't
                talk so loud! Somebody will hear you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do I care if they do?" returned Montcalm,
                raising his voice still higher. "You have ruined me and
                are laughing at me for it. Why should I not ruin you?
                If killing myself would atone for half the evil I have done,
                I would blow out my brains! If shooting you would
                restore that old man his farm, you would not live an
                instant!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "For God's sake. Trace," Durgenson said, "don't act
                so! You are crazy. What do you mean by saying you
                have been to hell?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you intimate that I lie?" asked Montcalm
                fiercely.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, no," said Durgenson, his astonishment and
                alarm increasing. "Of course you know where you've
                been."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," said Montcalm, with perfect composure, "I was
                in hell all night. I shall soon go back to stay forever.
                I am a devil and I know well the final home of devils.
                You had better leave me. There is no telling what violence
                you may tempt me to do."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is about what I was thinking," replied Durgenson,
                jumping across the brook. "You don't know who
                I can get to do the job I spoke of, do you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "The fellow who keeps so many dogs," said Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Durgenson walked in the direction of Sparks', wondering
                at the sudden change in his hitherto devoted helper.
                Montcalm, exhausted in his weakened state by the violence
                of his passion, sat down at the foot of a tree. When
                he had been seated a few minutes, he separated a letter
                from a bundle of papers in his pocket. It was written in
                a quaint, round hand, which would have been taken at
                once for that of an old lady.

                    <div class="body">
                        It has been a long time since I have heard from you. The last
                        letter you sent was when you gave me that fifty dollars. Now that
                        I am alone, I don't know what I should do if Cod hadn't given me a
                        good boy. You must have changed some since I saw you. That
                        was five years ago. You used to write once a week regularly. Now
                        you don't let me hear from you oftener than once a month. It seems
                        so different now from what it did when we were rich. But it was all
                        for the best. I have provisions enough. All I need now is to hear
                        from my boy. I pray for you every day, Traceworth, two or three
                        times a day. You know there was a spell when you didn't keep
                        good company. Remember what I have told you and keep away
                        from bad men.

                Montcalm put the letter with the papers into his pocket.
                Gloomily he left the woods to mingle in society which he
                hated, to listen to words the import of which he did not
                comprehend, to profess gayety while body and mind were
                being eaten away by the canker of remorse.

            </h2>
            <p>
                To the delight of the farmers there were indications of
                rain. Across the sky was drawn a curtain of cloud, which
                was uniform in appearance, except where it was slightly
                varied in shade by different degrees of density. From it
                fell a fine mist, which was welcomed as the harbinger of
                plentiful showers. Ratke's hands were gathered in the
                club-house, for the major would allow neither man nor
                beast to work in the storm on his premises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wingscheut, who that day was out of employment,
                joined his former fellow laborers for a visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Helloa!" exclaimed Thompson, approaching John,
                who was seated in the chamber. "What book you
                got?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ivanhoe," replied John. "Did you ever read it?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," returned Thompson, "that is, part of it, but I
                didn't go much on it. I couldn't make no sense out o'the
                thing."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell me about it," said John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, there ain't much to tell," said Thompson. "It
                don't amount to nothin'. There was this Iverhoe, he was
                a slow ole genius, took him all day to do a little bit, then
                there was a templar. He was black, a Nigger or an
                Injun, I don't know which. Then there was a maiden,
                an' the'd rip an' tear around after her to beat all. They
                had the funniest way o' fightin' you ever heerd of. They
                had spears, just like fish spears, only they didn't have but
                one tine. They couldn't do nothin' till they took them
                spears and got their horses to goin' lickety-larrup. But
                I've got the dandy book.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What is the name of it?" asked John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "'One-eyed Zeke,'" replied Thompson. "This Zeke, he
                was death on the Injuns. He'd make game of all of 'em
                he got in sight of. He'd shoot off his rifle, an'
                then he'd take a revolver in each hand. There wa'n't
                nothin' he couldn't do. One time they got 'im, but he
                let 'em. They'd been a-wantin' to git a steamboat on the
                river; so Zeke he run her to shore and pertended to be
                a-snoozin'. The Injuns, They come an' catched 'im and
                tied 'im, but they couldn't run the boat; so they had to
                let Zeke loose. Zeke, he told 'em to keep stuffin' in the
                wood an' a-stuffin' it in. Byme by he thought 'twas time
                to skip, an' so he dropped in the water. Then the biler
                busted an'blowed 'em all up, all but Zeke. Oh, that Zeke,
                he was a tearer! He'd killed more'n forty while this
                'ere Iverhoe was a-gittin' his spear ready."
            </p>
            <p>
                Unable to pursue his reading in quiet, John descended
                to the ground floor. The outside door opened and in
                walked Panicky.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here you are again," said Daggett, "You're just the
                man I want to see."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I like to come where I'm wanted," replied Panicky,
                taking from his shoulder the strap to which his satchels
                were slung. "There's once in a while a place where they
                don't appreciate me. But that's what a benefactor of his
                race must expect. They're persecuted and cursed by the
                ones they help the most. I'm nothing but a martyr. I'm
                out in all kinds of weather to give people the benefit of
                my medicine. It's my mission. You see the hump on
                my shoulders. I made that carrying my satchels, trying
                to benefit humanity. When I'm dead and gone, folks will
                know what they've lost."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're partial to the martyrs," said Daggett. "It ain't
                often we see a real one. Sometimes they come snides on
                us, fix 'em up bogus, Like Barnum's mermaid. You come
                just when you're needed, Panicky. We're all sick, and we
                want some martyr to tone us up. Wingscheut here wants
                a bottle of your panicky on his leg."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," objected Wingscheut. "it's a crowin'-out."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What are you using on it?" inquired Panicky.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Vell," answered Wingscheut, "tat's for you to fint out
                if you can, I'll tell for fife tollars, unt you can sell it
                to chust as many folks as you vant to."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Got a touch of summer complaint, have you?" asked
                Panicky, addressing Sheppard.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Got nothin'," returned Jake. "I'm tough as a biled
                owl."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Bad spell for general debility," said Panicky to
                Montcalm. "I see it's hit you bad."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am quite well," replied Montcalm. "If you think
                you can beat me pitching hay we will try it when the sun
                comes out."
            </p>
            <p>
                "John," said Daggett, "get your fiddle and play us a
                tune. I want to shake my feet."
            </p>
            <p>
                John brought down a recently purchased violin and
                played a lively air, to which Daggett beat an accompanying
                tattoo with his feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, I'll tell you what we'll do, Panicky," said
                Daggett, "and that's the best offer we'll make, that is, I'll
                go in for it if the rest of the boys will. If you'll step in
                there and dance a jig, we'll buy a partnership bottle of
                your panicky. What do you say, boys?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Panicky objected, but Daggett assured him that he
                could sell his medicine to them in no other way. Accordingly
                the two stepped into the middle of the room and
                began to dance a quickstep while John played. The
                music was quickened. Daggett was the first who failed to
                keep pace with the rapid notes. Panicky's superiority
                over his rival was now unquestioned. His body was
                nearly stationary, but his feet and legs twisted and turned
                like those of a jumping-jack; and from underneath them
                came a clatter which was almost like the rattle of a snare
                drum. He would not have lagged behind the music had
                its rate not been still further increased by John. As it
                was, he missed a few steps, recommenced further on, and
                at last, becoming hopelessly entangled, passed to the
                outside of the circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He's the best player I ever heard but one, and he was
                a foreigner," said Panicky, after John had gone. "Do
                you know where he come from?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "He won't tell any one that," replied Daggett. "It's
                queer, too. I never heard him speak of his folks or
                where he's been before he come here."
            </p>
            <p>
                That night John did his chores early. He was in the
                parlor before dark, for there was a matter which he wished
                to talk over with Manie. How strong were his hopes,
                what an unwonted confidence he had in the future as he
                entered the room and she greeted him with a smile.
                Despite her kind welcome he dreaded to broach the subject
                for which he had come. That which he had deemed
                assured now appeared very doubtful, and his voice grew
                so unsteady that he dared not ask his intended question.
                Just as his timidity was getting under subjection, Ratke
                opened the door and taking a seat beside him, began to
                discuss moral theories, for which, in the absence of
                Montcalm, he was anxious to find a listener. To the
                major and his niece John threw his glances, hesitating
                between a desire to please and to get rid of the
                troublesome philosopher. Ratke, exhausting the first subject,
                commenced another.
            </p>
            <p>
                To one of the philosopher's questions which he had
                imperfectly understood, John ventured an affirmative
                answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The same, then, you say," replied Ratke. "It is
                called the identical wave, but I cannot understand its
                right to claim identity, when it bears to it hardly a
                resemblance. It has undergone each of the two changes
                to which matter is subject. It is increased in size, and
                altered in composition. A political movement begins.
                Its authors die and are succeeded by leaders whose creeds
                and practices are antagonistic to theirs. The founders
                advocated thrift, economy, simplicity and progress; the
                followers advocate useless offices, vast expenditures, pomp
                and an adherence to methods the only recommendation
                of which is that they were necessary in an emergency.
                Patriotism and virtue have turned to self-interest and
                corruption. Why should we call this miserable relic the
                old party, when it has preserved its being neither in men
                nor in principles, only in name? Answer me that, John."
                "I see," said Ratke, "my words, sent to your brain
                without making an impression, form a case of total
                reflection. In the physical world this is possible only from
                a highly burnished surface but it is not so in the mental.
                The liability to total reflection increases as the square
                root of the intellectual vigor decreases. No offense is
                intended, John. Your age and the circumstances in which
                you are placed make the rule not applicable to you. No
                doubt you have heard enough about the wave and you
                want now to see its posterior as it recedes."
            </p>
            <p>
                With this good-natured conclusion the major rose and,
                taking a book from the library, went to the dining-room,
                where he was obliged to hear a harangue by Mrs. Grippin
                on the scarcity of wood.
            </p>
            <p>
                John had fancied that when his employer left, he would
                have no difficulty in stating the nature of his errand; but
                when he was alone with Miss Ratke, his old timidity returned.
                He would have been able to perform his mission
                at once had it not been for another request in reserve,
                which he wished her not to suspect.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this account he broached topics which were foreign
                to the theme uppermost in his thoughts. Finally he delivered
                this unscientific preliminary, "I am going to the
                concert at Oakville to morrow night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope you will have a good time," said his companion.
                "It is a local affair, I believe. Still, it will be
                quite interesting. They, have some good singers there."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I would like to have you go," said John, trying to
                assume a careless manner. "Will you be at home to-morrow
                night?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Certainly not all the time if I go with you," responded
                Miss Ratke, "and I believe I shall accept your invitation."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thank you," answered John, "I will call at about six."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very well," said Manie, "I promised Jennie Holmes
                to come to her house to-night and I must be going."
            </p>
            <p>
                John had performed his errand, yet he lingered at the
                door feeling that he had something still to tell. At last
                he said, "Good-bye."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good-bye," said Manie in surprise, "for how long?
                Not quite a day."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope not more than that," replied John. "But I
                have found that my expectations are not to be depended
                upon. That prospect on which I calculate most is apt to
                be most completely dissipated."
            </p>
            <p>
                He tried to keep warmth from his words and tones that
                they might not betray his longing to indulge in passionate
                utterance, utterance which, he thought, would warn
                Manie of the depth of his feeling and banish him from
                her beyond the possibility of a return. His whole being
                fought against the restraint. He threw back at her another
                look and saw a glance which appeared to contain
                encouragement, but which he could not analyze with certainty.
                An apprehension seized him that a golden opportunity
                was passing away, but its place was taken by another that
                speech would destroy a growing prospect. Their separation
                promised to be short; and yet, as if he were about
                to start on a long journey, he felt a desire to bid her a
                second and different farewell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Checking himself with the fear that he had already
                said too much, he left her presence. The next night he
                would stake his hopes on a revelation to Manie, which, if
                all circumstances were considered, did not promise a
                satisfactory result. He was not confident. He shut his eyes
                to the consequences, while a dread of failure was using its
                influence to dissuade him from his design.

                In the backyard he met Montcalm, who thus addressed
                him:
            </p>
            <p>
                "There is a little matter I meant to have spoken to you
                about before. Suppose we take a walk."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I cannot now," responded John, "I have an engagement."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Accommodate me as soon as you can, then," said
                Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Any time to-morrow," replied John, hastening to the
                club-house.
            </p>
            <p>
                He stayed a few minutes in the chamber and, bringing
                down his violin, was about to leave the building when
                Daggett stopped him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What, John, you ain't going away?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I must," Wrengell replied.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, pshaw!" ejaculated Daggett, "that's just the way
                when we need you. Well, go it. I don't blame you."
            </p>
            <p>
                After Wrengell's departure, Montcalm entered the
                clubhouse and asked concerning his whereabouts.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He's gone," answered Archer, "took his fiddle and
                gone."

            </h2>
            <p>
                From Ratke's Wrengell proceeded eastward. As he
                passed Takum's, he was loudly greeted by the dogs. They
                were, however, recalled by Philetus, for an infuriated
                Irishman had lately hurled a club with such force and
                precision that the larger pup had been permanently lamed
                and subsequently sold at a sacrifice. In the increasing
                darkness the great tamaracks, which were near the center
                of the causeway, could not be separately distinguished,
                but their masses cast a gloomy shade over the road and
                were easily discerned even against the clouded sky.
            </p>
            <p>
                John stopped at Wallace's house, the door of which
                was opened by Julia.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come in," said the maiden. "You live to the major's,
                don't you? Take off your hat and stay awhile."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is where I live," answered John. "Thank you,
                I cannot stop."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, now you better come in," insisted Julia, "It's
                just as cheap to set in the house as it is to poke around
                outdoors. Pa and Ab are gone away to-night, plague
                take 'em. I'm all alone and so lonesome I don't know
                what to do. We could git acquainted in no time."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can you tell me the way to Mrs. Boyle's?" asked
                John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why, it's too dark to git to Mrs. Boyle's," said Julia.
                "Of course I'll tell you the way, though. You go right up
                here to the first corner. Then you want to turn to your
                right. Then you take the first turn to your left. Then
                you take the first turn to your right. Then you go past
                two houses and you'll come to a gate. It's a funny gate,
                and I'll bet a cooky you never see one like it before. It's
                got a great monstrous beam on the top, and way on the
                end of that beam there's a box, and the box has got some
                big stones in it. You'd think it would be all you could
                do to lift it, but it swings around just like nothin'. Ole
                McDuff always makes his gates in that way. Well, you
                go in there and bear to your right till you come to a stake
                and rider fence. You foller that fence to the woods, and
                there you'll strike a path. That'll take you to Mrs.
                Boyle's. But you'll git sick of it. It's awful dark. You
                better come in and stay with me. We'll have a high ole
                time."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is impossible," replied John. "I promised to go
                to Mrs, Boyle's. Thank you for your information."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Say," exclaimed Julia suddenly. "I know the way
                and you don't. I better go along with you and show
                you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am much obliged," returned John, "but I can find
                the way from the description you gave. I do not want
                you to take any such trouble."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No trouble at all," replied Julia. "I'll be right out."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said John firmly, "I would rather go alone."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go it, devil," cried Julia angrily. "Start your stumps.
                Don't you never come here again."
            </p>
            <p>
                A little more than half a mile from Wallace's John
                came to four corners and turning south, recrossed the
                swamp, which near this point curved to the eastward.
                He reached the end of the road, which bent to the left,
                proceeded a short distance, circled to the right and
                presently arrived at the gate which had been described by
                Julia. He found it, as she had said, easy to open.
                There was comparatively little friction at the hinges, and
                the ponderous beam was so balanced by the end and box
                of heavy stones that it did not require lifting. The path
                went with many variations to the stake and rider fence,
                where it was straight until it reached the woods. The
                fence, higher at this place than at others, was securely
                staked and wired. Evidently it had been knocked down
                by careless pedestrians and rebuilt by the owner of the
                land in such a manner as to prevent all depredations
                except those of a wanton character.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was rejoiced when he stood at the edge of a clearing,
                from the farther side of which glimmered a light.
                His troubles were not yet over. Between him and the
                house were thickets of blackberry bushes, which caught in
                his clothes and scratched his face and hands. As he
                descended the rise of ground at the border of the woods, the
                light disappeared, and he groped without guidance to gain
                his destination. When he emerged from the thicket, he
                found that he had gone some rods out of his way.
                Congratulating himself that he had escaped with so few
                inconveniences on so dark a night, he advanced to the
                house and was admitted by the cattle-buyer, Durgenson.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cottage into which John stepped was small and
                humble, but comfortably furnished. In a corner of the
                principal room, which was at once kitchen and parlor,
                was a safe with scalloped newspapers placed over the top
                and hung on the doors. Near the safe was a table on
                which rested some curious stones and a few books. The
                walls were covered with paper, and from them were sus-
                pended pictures of little art, too long drawn to be called
                new, and too modern to be ranked as antiquities. That
                a person of Christian principles had assisted in furnishing
                the house was indicated by two Bibles, some Sabbath
                school papers, some religious works, including the life of
                Whitefield and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and a
                cardboard motto worked in zephyr which read, "Nearer,
                my God, to Thee." The only occupant of the cottage
                besides Durgenson was a dark-complexioned young man
                who had a short, bristling mustache, a sullen, resolute face,
                and eyes which were ever eluding the scrutiny of those
                whom he met. This evasion of the gaze of others resulted
                not from timidity, but from a desire to keep his
                thoughts to himself. Indeed, no sagacious observer
                would have ascribed cowardice to him, for such an
                imputation would have been contradicted by his every
                appearance. The lamp on the table was surrounded by
                millers, which darted against it, but were prevented by
                the chimney from reaching the flame. The young man
                busied himself by catching them, thrusting them into the
                lamp, and watching their death struggles with the keenest
                interest. When Durgenson introduced him, he shook
                Wrengells hand, still averting his eyes, and immediately
                resumed his occupation of catching millers.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was afraid it would be so dark you wouldn't come,"
                said the cattle-buyer. "You must have had a bad time
                getting through the woods. You kept the business secret,
                as I told you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "As nearly as I could," replied John. "I could never
                have found the way from the description you gave me.
                I inquired at a house after I started."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is that so?" asked Durgenson. "Where did you inquire?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "At Wallace's," answered John. "I said nothing
                about you. I merely asked the way to Mrs. Boyle's. I
                hope it did no damage."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no," said Durgenson. "Of course, when I go
                into anything, I don't advertise it. But probably no one
                will mistrust what you came for. I believe I didn't tell
                you what I wanted of you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What business do you wish to hire me to do?" asked John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The stock business," answered Durgenson. "I want
                you to drive and to buy cattle and horses, perhaps sheep."
            </p>
            <p>
                "But I have had no experience," objected John. "You
                would certainly lose if you had me use my poor judgment
                in buying."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't be too sure about that," returned Durgenson.
                "It's in you, and I know it. I've had my eye on you for
                quite a while. I can tell whether I want a man or not the
                first time I see him. I care more about honesty than
                experience. I had a cowboy to work for me once. He
                would guess the weight of a steer almost to a pound
                notch. But I wouldn't board that fellow for all he'd do.
                He'd get drunk, and then he'd either pay so much that I
                lost, or offer so little that the stockmen would get mad
                and wouldn't have anything to do with us. Then I had
                another hand that was steady and a good buyer, but he
                was always smousing me. It's hard to find one that's
                just right, mighty hard."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have a course of study which I am very anxious to
                finish," said John. "I really ought not to give my
                attention to new subjects now. But if you hire me, it
                will be necessary. What wages do you propose to give?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, as to that," Durgenson returned," I can't give
                you as much at first as I give an experienced hand. I
                wouldn't venture over fifty dollars a month and expenses
                for the first three months. After that, if I kept you at
                all, I could bid up to seventy-five or a hundred. I'd
                want you to commence right off."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I cannot do that," replied John. "I have hired to
                Major Ratke for all summer."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are sure you told no one about coming here?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No one except Miss Wallace," John replied, "and
                the boys at Ratke's did not know which way I came."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why I'm so careful," explained Durgenson, "Pease
                and I have quite a rivalry. I get the start of him once
                in a while, and he beats me when he can. Sometimes,
                after I've got a plan ready, he drops on to it and gets
                ahead of me. When I begin to hire men, he knows
                something is up, and he gets wind of it some way. Now,
                I'm satisfied there's money in a car-load of horses to put
                in here, and I mean to get them before he does."
            </p>
            <p>
                Glancing past the cattle-buyer, John saw an ugly shadow
                on the wall. It was the head of a man with an abnormally
                large nose and a savage, repulsive countenance.
                The exaggerated shape was made by the rays of the lamp
                falling on the face of young Boyle, who had finished his
                insect butchery and was sitting still and silent by the
                table. From each of his eyes was reflected a ball of light
                something like that which shines from the orb of an
                excited cat. John was momentarily impressed by the figure
                on the wall and the sullen behavior of the young man,
                who, he observed, looked at him often, but avoided
                meeting his direct gaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want you to begin your training to-night, Wrengell,"
                said Durgenson; "I've got my horse out here tied to a
                tree, and I want you to guess what he's worth."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What," asked John, "practice an art before learning
                the theory? You said that you would give me a book,
                so that I could get posted."
            </p>
            <p>
                "So I will," assured the stockman. "But you ought
                to take every opportunity to improve. If you can't afford
                to spend the time, I'll give you ten dollars rather than
                to have you unprepared when I'm ready to use you. You
                will acquire judgment. You'll guess with him, won't you
                Alf?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," answered young Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He's out there in the woods tied to a tree," explained
                Durgenson. "The stable door is so narrow I couldn't
                make him go through it. You must tell me what he is
                best adapted for, running, trotting or pulling."
            </p>
            <p>
                A bat flew in at a window and displeased with its new
                quarters, circled about the room in desperate but
                unavailing efforts to escape. Young Boyle rushed at it,
                struck it down with a narrow piece of thin board and picking it
                up, made sure of its death by crushing it between his fingers.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he was tossing the lifeless creature through the
                window, a woman entered the door which had admitted
                John, She was about fifty years of age, was plainly
                dressed, and, John thought, had the most benevolent face
                he had ever seen. She appeared astonished at finding
                so many occupants in the house, and looked from John to
                Durgenson as if to ascertain the object or objects of their
                visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What are you here for?" growled young Boyle, with
                an oath. "I thought you was goin' to stay to Blake's
                all night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mrs. Blake is better," responded the woman meekly,
                "Mrs. Sparks and Mrs. Holmes are both there, and they
                said I might as well come home, I have been up two
                nights in succession, and I can rest better here than
                there."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'd have stayed till mornin' an' got my breakfast," said
                Boyle. "You've earned your board there, I guess."
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is Mr. Durgenson, I think," remarked the woman,
                after a long survey of the cattle-buyer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is my name," replied Durgenson, "but I don't
                remember where we ever got acquainted."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am Mrs. Boyle," said the woman, "We met at
                Chicago after the death of Mr. and Mrs. Lehmann. Perhaps
                you will remember that Mr. Boyle and I were their
                nearest neighbors."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes," answered Durgenson, with a show of uneasiness,
                "It was so long ago I wouldn't have recognized
                you if you hadn't spoken about our being acquainted."
            </p>
            <p>
                "And this young man," said Mrs. Boyle, "I have
                never met him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Excuse me," Durgenson apologized, "I'll introduce
                you."
            </p>
            <p>
                John wondered that so refined a lady should have so
                brutal a son. It struck him that he was having a generous
                share of her attention and that, courteous as she had
                seemed, she was allowing her curiosity to master her
                civility.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That looks like a violin case," said Mrs. Boyle. "Do
                you play, Mr. Wrengell?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have had some practice on that instrument," replied John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wish you would play for us," said Mrs. Boyle, "I
                like to hear music."
            </p>
            <p>
                The lady's interest in John apparently increased as she
                listened to the strains of the violin. Her eyes brightened;
                the kindly expression on her face was intensified to a
                degree which reached regard and love.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is beautiful," she said, when John had finished
                the air. "I have thought that the violin ought to be used
                in church. There is truth in saying that the Devil ought
                not to be allowed all the best music. I hope you don't
                play for dances."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, ma'am," he replied. "That is, not for public
                dances," he added, recollecting his performance in the
                club-house.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am glad to hear that," said the lady. "You could
                do so much good if you wished. Think how many you
                could draw to the house of God, some that would not
                come for anything only to hear good music. There is a
                great responsibility resting on you, Mr. Wrengell. You
                must use your talents rightly or they may be taken
                away."
            </p>
            <p>
                John felt at this gentle rebuke a sense of shame which
                would not have been imparted by harsher censure.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I presume you play on other instruments," continued
                Mrs. Boyle. "A good organ player can make himself
                very useful. The organ is used so much for sacred
                music."
            </p>
            <p>
                A loud squalling, as of some cats about to engage in
                desperate battle, arose outside the cottage. On hearing
                the sound Boyle sprang up and went hurriedly to a bedroom
                where he rummaged noisily about, but he soon reappeared,
                bearing a double-barreled shotgun.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What are you going to shoot, Alfred?" inquired
                Mrs. Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm a-goin' to shoot them cats," returned the young
                fellow, whom we, like Durgenson, will call Alf.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, don't do that," protested Mrs. Boyle. "It may
                be Mr. Lowry's Bob. You know how much they think
                of him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let 'em keep him to home, then," gruffly returned
                Alf, passing out of the house. "There'll be a howlin'
                out here all night. I won't lose my rest for no cat."
            </p>
            <p>
                In a few minutes he returned, disappointed, from his
                hunt. Resuming his chair by the table, he sat with his
                forehead so traversed by wrinkles that its primarily narrow
                surface was much diminished and his eyebrows almost
                met his hair. After a short occupation of this
                seat, he arose and again went to the bedroom. When he
                emerged, he walked straight to the outside door, looking
                neither to the right nor to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you going away, Alfred?" asked Mrs. Boyle,
                with an anxiety which she could not suppress.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's none o' your bisness where I'm goin', "he replied,
                turning furiously about, the wrinkles on his brow
                changed in direction from horizontal to perpendicular,
                "I'm of age, I thank you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, Wrengell," said Durgenson when Alf's footsteps
                were no longer audible to them, "we'd like to hear
                another tune. At least, I would."
            </p>
            <p>
                John complied with Durgenson's request and putting
                his violin in its case, announced his intention to leave.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, what's the use of being in a hurry?" said the
                cattle-buyer. "You've got all night to go home in. I'll
                light you through the woods with a lantern."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Will you do an errand for me?" asked Mrs. Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Certainly," answered John. "What do you wish?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Take a letter to Mrs. Grippin if you will. I will see
                if I can find it."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Boyle lighted a lamp, proceeded to the bedroom
                and closed the door. Presently she came out with two
                envelopes in her hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am sorry to keep you waiting," she said, handing John
                an envelope. "I haven't my glasses on. Perhaps you
                can tell which one of these is directed to Mrs. Grippin."
            </p>
            <p>
                When she had finished speaking, Mrs. Boyle stood between
                John and Durgenson, close to the latter, so that the
                view between the two men was almost wholly obstructed.
                The first envelope which John scanned was addressed to
                Mrs. Cyrus Boyle, Detroit, Mich. The second bore the
                following inscription: "Do not go back the way you
                came. Go back of the house and you will find a road
                that you must follow. Look out for Durgenson and my
                son. Remember."
            </p>
            <p>
                John could hardly repress a start of surprise as he read
                this warning, which made a strong and instantaneous
                impression. Neither in the appearance of Mrs. Boyle nor in
                that of Durgenson was there any confirmation of the message.
                Her countenance was still untroubled, and he was
                as smiling and good-natured as ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll go with you," said Durgenson. "We'll want a
                lantern. We can't get through without."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thank you," returned John, "I shall not need your
                help."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now don't forget my errand," said Mrs. Boyle. "My
                son is careless once in a while. You must remember."
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you'll get a lantern, Mrs. Boyle," said Durgenson,
                "I'll go to the fields with him. He'll never find the way
                out alone."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said John, in a positive tone, "I do not need any
                company, nor am I anxious to have a lantern."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'd. like to speak to you a minute," remarked Durgenson,
                "just a minute."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come to Major Ratke's, then," John returned, as he
                quickly left the room.

                CHAPTER XVII.<br>
                <small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SWAMP.</small>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The night was lighter than it had been when John arrived
                at Mrs. Boyle's. The curtain which shrouded the
                sky was torn in a few places, and through the rents here
                and there was gleaming a star.
            </p>
            <p>
                John ran across the cleared space back of the house,
                meeting but one obstacle, a stump, which threw him and
                slightly bruised his leg. The interval between the house
                and the woods, or more properly the brush, was short;
                and it was not long before he was in the woods to which
                Mrs. Boyle had alluded. It had formerly been a wagon
                track, but of late it had been so seldom used by teams
                that one side of it was grown over with weeds, although
                the other was beaten down by foot passengers. Its width
                aided him in keeping it, and, moreover, the near bushes
                by their sharp briars notified him whenever he encroached
                on their territory.
            </p>
            <p>
                He began to feel that his alarm in the house was
                unnecessary and that he had acted rudely toward Durgenson,
                who certainly had given him no cause for such treatment.
                His refusal of guidance through the woods seemed
                to him every moment more rude and uncalled for. And
                yet he could account for Mrs. Boyle's warning only by
                one of two suppositions, that she had some reason for her
                extraordinary caution or that she was insane. After she
                had handed him the envelope, she had disarmed the suspicion
                of the cattle-buyer by calmness and feigned indifference,
                such as might be used by a sly lunatic who was
                planning to deceive his keeper. He resolved that at the
                next opportunity he would amply apologize to Durgenson,
                though he could not imagine a way in which he might
                explain his uncivil departure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The road ended at the edge a field, beyond which
                was some large timber, which was faintly visible. The
                intervening ground had been recently plowed by some
                unenterprising farmer who was late in the preparation of his
                summer fallow. Much of it lay up in large masses, which
                fell in pieces when it was trodden upon, for the dry
                weather had not baked it as it had the more easily
                influenced clay. John debated whether he would follow the
                edge of the improvement or enter the woods, but he soon
                adopted the latter course.
            </p>
            <p>
                A short, distance from the field was a steep descent leading
                to the swamp, which here, at the end of a considerable
                stretch to the east, turned abruptly southward. He was
                at the bottom of the hill, preparing to return to the
                higher ground, when he heard in the bushes at his right a
                crashing, which, had he been in an eastern tropical jungle,
                he might have imagined to be made by a hippopotamus or
                an elephant. The crashing, together with its supplement,
                the sound of heavy and frequent blows from a cudgel,
                receded farther to the interior of the swamp. The day and
                the night of unusual circumstances had fortified John
                against surprises, yet they had not so far stripped him of
                curiosity as to keep him from wishing to unravel the
                mystery. Leaving his violin by a tree which he thought he
                could readily find, he followed the retreating noise, which,
                though varying in volume, was continuous and was an
                excellent safeguard against his being discovered by those
                who made it. It occurred to him that in thus dogging the
                footsteps of others, when he could assign no good reason
                for so doing, he was playing an unworthy part; but, as
                many a comparatively upright man had done before him,
                he subordinated his strictest sense of honor to the
                fulfillment of his desire. He soon came near enough to the
                disturbance to ascertain that two men were conducting a
                horse through the swamp, one leading him by a halter,
                the other occasionally belaboring him with a tamarack
            </p>
            <p>
                "Touch him up," said Wallace, who held the halter-strap
                and a lantern. "We won't get out of here till morning
                unless we're careful."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll warm his ole sides," responded Ab. "Git along
                here with you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You want to look out, Ab," warned the father, "You
                don't know who's prowling around."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, you're always a worryin', dad," returned Ab,
                "I'm a-talkin' low. There ain't anybody goin' to poke
                around here at one o'clock for fun."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, the first thing we know we'll get gobbled,"
                complained Wallace. "There'll be a pile of profit in that,
                I've a good notion to say I'll quit this kind of work. You
                can't make much of a living at it. There, I've got my
                foot in one of them devilish holes again! I'm wet clear
                up to my hips. I don't expect anything but what I'll be
                sick to-morrow with the rheumatism."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, this'll only just limber you up, dad," consoled Ab.
                "You ain't dead yet. You can grunt."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wish you wouldn't be so cunning," returned Wallace,
                with a whine. "It don't feel funny to be all crippled up.
                You know how I was last winter and you hadn't ought to
                laugh."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why don't you laugh, too? That's what 'ud do you
                good. Come, chirk up, dad. Less hear how 'twould
                sound for you to talk without that whine."
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you felt like I do, you wouldn't be so chipper," said
                Wallace.
            </p>
            <p>
                They had now reached a lower and thinner growth of
                bushes, where John could not follow them so closely as he
                had done without incurring a strong risk of detection.
                For a time, therefore, their conversation was unintelligible
                to him. As they entered the tamaracks, he quickened his
                pace and was presently at no great distance from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was several miles below the retreat which had
                been fitted by Montcalm, and the use of which had been
                abandoned on account of the possibility that it had been
                discovered during the great hunt and that it would be
                secretly watched.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wish we had a market for these horses, dad," said
                Ab, "We'd make something then."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm a-going to have a bigger share of 'em than I git
                now," said Wallace, "or I won't work."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's what you've said before," replied Ab, "but
                you keep right on."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, there's no use of it," said Wallace. "I can do
                such business just as well as Montcalm can. He won't
                fool me much longer. I'll make him an offer; and then,
                if he don't come to my terms, we'll go it on our own
                hook."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now you're showin' some spunk," returned Ab. "We
                can sell horses as well as he can. He's one of the
                middlemen you tell about. Takes all of the profits and don't
                labor himself."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There wouldn't be any trouble about selling 'em,"
                declared Wallace. "When you get the start of me on a
                horse dicker, you've got to be up in the morning, I ain't
                a bit afraid but what I could show Trace Montcalm a
                trick or two."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who do you suppose the boss is that he's tellin' so
                much about?" asked Ab.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't believe there is any," said Wallace. "That's
                one of his lies. He thought if he said that, he could grind
                our faces under a kind of a monopoly. I'll let him know
                what I think about it, too. I ain't dependent on him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Less have the whole benefit of this one ourselves,"
                proposed Ab. "We're sharp enough for that. We can
                sell him and not be caught. We can do anything
                Montcalm can."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We'll see," said Wallace. "Hold the horse while I
                pull up these few trees in front. I wish Whipple knew
                how to break a colt. This one won't half lead."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ab had started for the purpose of taking the halter-strap,
                when the animal, jerking away from the elder
                Wallace, plunged among the trees, which at this place
                were not unusually thick, and circling about a large fallen
                tamarack, went toward the hard land in a course parallel
                with the road. Ab raced hurriedly back along the cleared
                strip, turning his head to one side, although his attempts
                to see the beast which he wished to intercept were
                necessarily unavailing. So intent was he on securing his lost
                plunder and so little light came through the tops of the
                trees, that without warning he came full against John, who
                was in the act of rising from his crouching position.
                Quickly gathering himself, he rushed among the tamaracks
                exclaiming, "Run, dad, run!"
            </p>
            <p>
                The lantern which Wallace carried was immediately
                extinguished. The sounds of three bodies, one at the left
                and two at the right, were heard moving through the
                swamp. John endeavored to follow one of the objects at
                the right. He had no hope or intention of capturing the
                Wallaces, who at such a place and at such an hour would
                prove inconvenient prisoners to one man unsupported.
                It was, he thought, advisable for him to secure the colt,
                restore him to his owner, and testify to what he had seen
                and heard. Groping carefully and keeping his hands before
                his face were necessary precautions for protection
                against the limbs, some of which were dry, pointed, and
                hard. The horse was moving from him, but its retreat
                was slower than his advance. It was proceeding toward
                an opening in the tamaracks, through which could be seen
                patches of nearly cloudless sky.
            </p>
            <p>
                This opening was on each side of the creek which ran
                lengthwise of the swamp. On the bank of the stream the
                colt stood, undecided as to which direction he should
                pursue. When John went toward him, he did not run
                away, but turning, remained with his heels suggestively
                presented. The man again made a circuit, and again the
                horse anticipated his design and gave a quiet but
                significant challenge, John persevered long in his endeavors,
                but at last, seeing their uselessness, he decided to retrace
                his way, giving no further notice to the colt. Accordingly,
                he set out to regain the road which he had quitted; but
                he had no sooner undertaken this task than he was
                followed by the colt, which seemed bent on keeping neither
                afar off nor in close proximity. Near a tall stub which
                loomed above the smaller trees, he stopped to ascertain
                his location and the course which it was best
                for him to follow. He was in a stunted, rather
                thin growth of the tamaracks. About him were trunks,
                the diameters of which were out of proportion to their
                heights, and limbs which reached far outward as if vainly
                trying to extend themselves over the entire surface of the
                ground. Farther on were the tops of the smaller trees
                which were too dense for penetration by the vision of one
                who was not in their midst. After he had calculated upon
                his probable distance from the place which he wished to
                reach, he selected a conspicuous broken tree-top as a
                landmark and advanced toward it. From this he was obliged
                to proceed unaided by a visible goal, for the trees were
                so nearly of a height and so close together that a distance
                of a few feet sufficed to make them indistinguishable. He
                thought the way to the road very long and very tedious.
                Now and then he halted to make observations, but as
                they were invariably limited to thirty square rods of
                swamp and an indefinite expanse of sky, they were productive
                of no good. It was with a feeling of relief that he saw
                the perceptible stretch of the now well-lighted heavens
                move downward and expand as the tamaracks diminished
                in stature. But his joy was dissipated when he found that
                he had traversed a circle and returned to the broken tree
                which he had left a few minutes before. Once more he
                set out, and once more, making the circuit, came back to
                the familiar stub. He now concluded that by another
                direction he would try to reach the upland. His next attempt
                was to return to the creek, and this he accomplished.
                It was now morning. He wandered up and down the
                creek, but he was unable to find a ford. In desperation
                he retreated a few paces from the stream and running up
                to the edge, jumped with all his might.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creek was so wide that a trained athlete might not
                easily have cleared it at a leap; and he landed, therefore,
                in the muddy bottom, where he sank above his waist.
                Luckily for him, he struck within reach of some bushes,
                which afforded so good a hold that by hard pulling he
                was able to extricate himself. Striking out from this
                point, he met with the same success which had attended
                his efforts on the opposite side.
            </p>
            <p>
                But by following the creek, he reasoned, in the course
                of a mile or two he would arrive at a public highway.
                With this end in view he proceeded down the left bank.
                A walk of thirty rods brought him to a bridge which was
                curiously constructed of poles. Across it teams and
                wagons had been driven, and from the right bank branched
                two roads. Passing over the creek, he took the left track,
                which turned and led him back to the bridge. He recrossed
                it, satisfied that he was in a fair way to reach the
                improvements. The colt, which had awaited him on the
                right bank, and had followed him along the circuitous road
                approached the edge, snorted, stepped on the poles carefully
                at first, and then finished the risky passage with a
                sudden rush. The road wound among the trees, its
                undulations indicating the way which had been most easy
                to clear, it brought John to some scattered bushes
                bordering a sandy slope where blossomed buckwheat was
                growing. He gained the eminence and beheld the welcome
                signs of civilization--houses, farms, orchards and
                cultivated fields. The sun was well up, and the hour for
                beginning farm labor had arrived. Between him and the
                nearest house young cattle and milk cows were grazing.
                Near the road and far to the right a boy was riding a
                wheel cultivator. The creak of a plow wheel came
                from the opposite side of an untrimmed hedge at
                the left. The hedge gave place to a board fence about
                midway in the line of division which separated the two
                fields. As John climbed the fence, the plow approached,
                drawn by two bay horses, one of which was wind-broken.
                The plowman had a sunburned, rather disagreeable
                countenance. He wore an old felt hat which was tucked
                under at the sides, so that it stuck out in peaks before
                and behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good-morning," said John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good-morning, sir," responded the plowman.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can you tell me where I am?" asked John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I guess I can," answered the plowman. "Looks to
                me as if you was in my field."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I got lost in the swamp," said John, "and I have no
                idea where I am. Am I still in Jefferson Township?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," replied the man, "you ain't in that county.
                You're in Washtenaw, now, township of Warren."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wish to go to Break o'Day," said John. "Will you
                please direct me so that I can find the way?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go to the road and make north. By and by you'll
                come to the forks. One comes here and one goes to
                Sharptown. You want to take the handle and that leads
                to Break o'Day. Helloa, is that your horse?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The exclamation was caused by the colt, which had
                trotted to the fence and was whinnying to the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," answered John, "he followed me from the
                swamp."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Followed you from the swamp!" echoed the plowman.
                "That's funny that he should be in there."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," said John, thinking it best to impart his newly
                gained information first to the authorities and afterward
                to the owner of the horse, "I found him there, and he
                seemed as anxious to get out as I."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did you catch him?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I did not."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm going to try it now," said the man, climbing the
                fence. "Oh, you bloody brute!" he ejaculated, quickly
                retreating, as the colt whirled and stood with his heels
                toward him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can I get something to eat at your house?" inquired
                John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, now, I don't know. It's just as the woman
                says about that. You can go up and ask her."
            </p>
            <p>
                In twenty minutes John was leaving the house with his
                hunger appeased. It was with self-congratulations on his
                escape from the swamp, that, avoiding the graveled walk
                which lay between circular beds of flowers, he passed
                through the large gate and took long, steady strides toward
                Break o'Day.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Break o'Day is one of the oldest villages in Jackson
                County. It had its store and its school-house before the
                first building was erected in Sharptown or Oakville. The
                derivation of its name has been the subject of many
                inquiries, which have been answered by local antiquarians.
                The founders of the hamlet, like the majority of Michigan
                pioneers, came from New York. Four families built
                their houses neat together, that they might enjoy the
                society of neighbors. Others followed from the Empire
                State, and the neighborhood became thinly settled. They
                had dwelt on the eastern hills, where, unobstructed, a view
                extended for miles. They were now in the midst of woods,
                where they could view no distant object unless it were
                above the timber. Month after month they lived in this
                manner, and daily the complaints grew louder. The
                women, who had been accustomed to habits of thrift,
                longed to see the sun rise once more. They declared it
                was nothing but laziness which allowed them to be penned
                up in that fashion, that if they were men, they would chop
                out at least one place wide enough to give them a sight
                through the forest. Urged on by their wives, the men
                made a bee and hewed to the eastward a road through
                which the earliest beams of the daily luminary might shine.
                The next morning the entire population of the locality
                gathered to witness the blaze of light which slowly
                appeared above the long stretch of stumps. Shouts
                resounded, guns were fired, a feast was spread, and the
                place was promptly named Break o'Day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The village never grew to the dimensions which were
                anticipated for it by its first builders. Twenty years ago
                its appearance was substantially as it is to-day. It was
                built on five corners from which ran roads, one to each
                cardinal point of the compass and one southeast to Sharptown.
                The greater part of the buildings were on the triangle formed
                by the eastern and south-eastern streets and
                the cross street which connected them. These streets were
                named in order, Warren, Jackson and Washington. On
                Warren were the church and the school-house; on Jackson,
                Birch and Bigney's store and the hotel; on Washington,
                the hardware store and the blacksmith-shop. Marion,
                running northward, could boast only of dwelling-houses.
                The drugstore of Dr. Rorus was the one building of
                importance on the west road, which, on account of its
                shade trees, the villagers named Maple Street, but which the
                farmers in derision called Scrub Avenue. This edifice
                was painted yellow, had a high square front, a shed roof,
                and bore the following inscription, "I. J. H. Rorus,
                M. D., Physician and Surgeon."
            </p>
            <p>
                On the morning which succeeded the night of John
                Wrengell's sojourn in the swamp, Dr. Rorus opened his
                drugstore in good season for the purpose of taking his
                indispensable dram. The doctor had won the reputation
                of being always drunk, and, intentionally or
                unintentionally, he preserved his notoriety.
            </p>
            <p>
                The streets were, as yet, traversed by few people.
                Most of the inhabitants were eating breakfast. The
                stores, however, were open, and from the blacksmith-shop
                came the energetic clinking of a hammer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rorus went behind his counter and poured out a glass
                of spirits, which he swallowed with relish. Repeating the
                potations at frequent intervals, he managed to get himself
                well under the influence of liquor.
            </p>
            <p>
                His first caller was an agent who had lodged at the
                hotel and who was canvassing for a paper which had
                recently started in Oakville.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Subscribe for a paper in Oakville?" said the doctor.
                "No, sir, not if every bottle of ink and every sheet of
                paper and every letter of type and every press were
                concentrated in that nest of infamy, Oakville."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I didn't know there was such a feeling here toward
                Oakville," said the agent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ah, sir," replied Rorus, "you talk of prejudice. Let
                me recite facts to you and history, history that shall dispel
                doubt 'like mists that rise before the sun.' Like the fogs
                that roll upward from our noble swamp, or mosquitoes
                that fly before--when there's a smudge. We helped
                Oakville with her fair, and that was all right. This year we
                wanted a celebration, and she said, 'We won't have any.'
                We got up one, and what did Oakville do? She turned right
                square around and got up too, and we couldn't get any
                crowd. What did she do it for? For the money. For the
                trade. Think of it, speculating on the Fourth of July. On
                what day? Remember, no common day, but on that glorious,
                that immortal, that never-to-be-forgotten day, when
                American liberty reached its culmination, its pinnacle, its
                apex, its--high as it could get. What do you think of that
                recreant, that rascal who can on that day even think of, or
                reach out his hand to clutch ten cents, or one dollar, or
                ten dollars. And yet, I grieve to say that in this land,
                consecrated to the rights of humanity, such men exist.
                They are in Oakville. They live, they breathe, they taint
                the pure air of freedom."
            </p>
            <p>
                The drizzling rain of the preceding day had forced a
                temporary suspension of haying, so that the store began
                to be populated by loungers from the near farms as well
                as from the village.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Doctor," said a man, who carried a large black bottle,
                "my wife is sick and I'd like to get some medicine."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very well," replied the doctor. "These men forget
                who their fathers were. They are not like the citizens of
                Break o'Day. Break o'Day remembers. Do you see
                that street yonder? That is Warren, and Warren sleeps
                on Bunker Hill."
            </p>
            <p>
                "But, Doctor," urged the man with the bottle, "my
                wife is bad off, and she's got to have some spirits."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, yes, just so," Rorus responded. "Do you see
                the church? That is on Jackson Street. Break o'Day
                remembers Old Hickory. Oh, he was the man for you!
                Well, he was. Firm, immovable, rigid, had a backbone.
                Right up yonder is Washington Street. Break o'Day
                remembers the Father of his Country. Oh, that George
                Washington, greatest man in all history, very greatest.
                The French shot at him. The Indians shot at him. The
                cold December and January and February (yes, at that's
                the coldest of the whole), they nipped at his feet. But
                did they hurt him ? No, sir."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Doctor," protested the waiting customer, "my wife is
                awful sick."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll wait on you in just a minute," said the physician.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who would make a good correspondent for this
                place?" inquired the Oakville agent, wishing to gain
                information before Rorus recommenced his harangue.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well," answered the doctor, "there's Ned Sturgis
                over in the post-office. He's a mighty smart fellow.
                Posted right up to the handle. You couldn't do any better
                than to get him. Then, there's my clerk, Fred Loomis,
                he's a bright one. Smart as steel. You never noticed
                him, did you? He'd pick up everything there was going.
                Quick-witted, you know. Catches on to anything before
                other folks have a glimpse of it. I wouldn't wonder if
                he's the best one you'll run across, Ned Sturgis is good.
                I sha'n't say which is the best. My clerk, though, he is
                A number one. You don't know what the boy is till you
                are acquainted with him. Now, I sha'n't say which is the
                best. But, of the two, of the two, my clerk's a
                le-etle--le-etle--I sha'n't draw any distinction."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Doctor," said the impatient man, "If you can't wait
                on me, I'm going over to Sullivan's. I know I can get it
                there."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, immediately," replied the doctor. "You are sure
                your wife is sick?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I should think so. She like to have died this morning,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have to be particular," said Rorus; "I can't sell only
                for medicinal purposes."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sullivan ain't so particular," said the customer.
                "I can go there any time an' get all the whisky I
                want."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is a disgrace to Break o'Day," commented the
                doctor. "That reproach to society, that den of iniquity,
                that abominable hole, should be closed up. To whom are
                they selling? To the merchant, to the farmer, to the
                clerk, to the business man, to the mechanic, to the laborer,
                to the agriculturist, to--lots of 'em. And yet, Michigan,
                mind you, no common State, but the Wolverine State, has
                enacted a law that no intoxicating beverage shall be sold
                except for medicinal purposes."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Say, I'd like to see you a minute," remarked a man,
                coming close to the physician.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That you can," replied the doctor. "Right this
                way."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I've got the ague," said the man in a low tone, when
                they had gone to the back of the store, "and I want
                something to break it up. I'd like to get some quinine and
                whisky."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good idea," assented Rorus. "Grand thing for ague,
                this quinquina. I have it pure, too. I'll put them up
                separately and let you mix them, eh?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The next event was the arrival of Wingscheut with his
                shambling limp.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Helloa, Wingscheut," was the salutation of Jimmy
                Martin. "Have you been hunting horse-thieves or bears
                lately.? Set down and give us a story."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," sturdily replied the German, "I'fe cot to see te
                toctor."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why," inquired Martin, "be you sick?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," answered Wingscheut, "unt I ton't vant to pe
                sick. Tat's te reason I see te toctor. I vass pit vith a
                massauker 'unt I must have some visky."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want to speak a word with you," said a youth of
                not more than twenty, after Wingscheut had obtained
                his liquor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come this way," said the doctor, going immediately
                to his consultation room.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm at work on a marsh where there's lots of
                rattlesnakes," said the youth. "I'm afraid I'll be bit and
                maybe not get help till it's too late. I wish you'd let me
                have a pint of whisky."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can't do that," returned Rorus. "Can't do it
                possibly. It's against the law."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know it," pleaded the youth, "but maybe I'll die
                if you don't. You let the rest have it. I do my trading
                here, that is, everything you keep. I'll have to go
                somewhere else if you can't accommodate me a little."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Human life," said the doctor, "must be preserved.
                Laws are for humanity. Humanity first and laws afterward.
                You can have it. But mind you don't lisp it outside
                the store."
            </p>
            <p>
                Wingscheut, wishing a change of society, wandered to
                another part of the village.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two men in an open buggy came driving rapidly from
                the west. One of them tied the horse quickly, and they
                entered the drugstore. The half-drunken crowd saw
                nothing unusual in their haste, but Rorus, intoxicated as
                he was, perceived that they had not the serenity of the
                Break o'Day loungers.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, Whipple," said the physician, "what's the
                news up your way? Everything quiet, s'rene, like a
                great ship sailing peacefully along with her sails
                outspread to the breeze of heaven?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "It ain't been very quiet," responded Whipple. "My
                bay colt was stole last night, that I wouldn't have took
                two hundred dollars for."
            </p>
            <p>
                The loungers arose. Rorus advanced from behind the
                counter. The stupor on the sottish faces gave place to
                excitement as Whipple related how he had become
                apprised of the theft.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I've had him locked up in the barn nights ever since
                last winter for fear he would be stole. Along the fore
                part of the summer I slept in the barn. But lately I
                hadn't heard so much about such business, so I got of
                my guard. This morning I says to my hired man, 'Ben,
                if your hand's sore, maybe I'd better milk and let you
                tend to the horses.' 'All right,' says Ben, 'my hand is
                purty sore to milk.' I went to the house and s'posed
                everything was all right. After breakfast I says to Ben,
                'Did you turn Jack out"' 'No,' says Ben, 'didn't
                you?' 'No,' says I, 'I ain't been in the stable.'
                'That's funny,' says Ben. 'It was unlocked.' We
                went out there, and sure enough he was gone. And it's
                just the same as the rest of 'em. We can't find his tracks.
                Something ought to be done. We've stood this stealing
                as long as we can. There's a whole gang of the thieves
                around, and they ought to be broke up."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'd like to see one of 'em git caught," said the
                flaxen-whiskered man, the same who the night of the hunt
                had quarreled with Ratke over the proposed punishment of
                the horse-thieves. "He'd be made short work of. The
                hull country's worked up, and they'd string a man, too,
                quick. What are you goin' to do about catchin' your colt?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know what to do," replied Whipple. "I thought,
                though, that I'd go around and inquire and have my
                neighbors do the same. They've gone now from around
                my way. I'll go over to my brother-in-law's Bill Briggses,
                and he'll turn out. Maybe by going far enough some of
                us can hear where he's gone to."
            </p>
            <p>
                The general attention was directed to a quarrel between
                Jimmy Martin and the youth who had used so much
                persuasion to obtain the bottle of whisky. Martin had
                stepped on the toes of the youth, whose name was Blake.
                Blake complained of the act and was told that he was a
                liar. He demanded an apology, which Martin refused
                to give. Thereupon he threw off hia coat and vest,
                rolled up his shirt-sleeves, unbuttoned and turned down
                his shirt-collar and advanced in fighting attitude toward
                Martin, who made no preparation for the attack.

                Dr. Rorus passed around the large round stove to
                separate the disputants. Grabbing each by the collar,
                he exclaimed, "What! Gen'lemen! Quarreling in a
                time of public danger, when the welfare and the safety of
                the community is at stake! Quarreling when our property
                and our rights and our sacred honor are at stake!
                For it's a question of honor, gen'lemen. You'll all say
                it's dishonorable to steal horses, won't you? Then it's
                dishonorable to let 'em be stole. Do you know what
                town you're in? Break o'Day, and Break o'Day has
                the fires of patriotism. You should be ready to leave off
                and lay aside and forget, you know, your little feuds and
                animosities. Would George Washington have stopped
                for a little fuss at Yorktown? Would Joseph Warren
                have paused for a racket, just a common blow up, I mean,
                on the sacred soil of Bunker Hill? Do you suppose, my
                dear sir, that Mad Anthony Wayne would have stopped
                charging up Stony Point because some one stepped on
                his toe? Others may wrangle in a time of public calamity,
                but," he concluded with a leonine roar, "I. J. H.
                Rorus, never, no, never."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You won't have to go to Bill's, Whipple," said the
                flaxen-whiskered man. "There he comes now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, Bill," said Whipple, as soon as the new-comer
                was in their midst, "I've lost my bay colt."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I guess not," replied Briggs, at whose house Wrengell
                had stopped for breakfast. "He's in my barn now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," cried Whipple. "Where did you find him?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "In my field tagging after a fellow that come from th
                swamp. He said he got lost, and your colt followed
                him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't believe no such yarn," exclaimed Whipple.
                "He stole him, and the cold got away. What did he say
                about it, any way?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Briggs, with considerable exaggeration, gave an account
                of his interview with John, dwelling particularly on the
                way in which the latter had withheld his name and place
                of residence. "He was covered with mud from head to
                foot," said Briggs, "and he had scratches on his face and
                hands. I'm inclined to think he and his pards had a
                disagreement. It wouldn't be strange if that's how he come
                to roll in the mud and get the scratches. While he was
                eating, I skipped around through the fields and come here.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drugstore was in a state of tumult. The chairs
                were deserted, and the men stood, some lethargic with
                drink, some talking boisterously and urging immediate
                action.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We'll go right down there and get him," said Whipple,
                "and we'll hear what he has to say for himself. If he
                can't tell a straight story, he may as say his prayers."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's the talk," exclaimed the flaxen-whiskered man.
                "We may just as well make an example of him. That's
                what we swore to do with the first one we caught."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We ain't sure that he stole him," said Briggs, who was
                alarmed at the effect his words were producing, and who
                that day learned to his regret that it is easier to incite
                than to appease the fury of a drunken mob. "I don't
                know but most any one would look suspicious if he was
                mudded up and scratched up that way."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Trot out your rope," yelled young Blake. "Less be
                a-going."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, doctor," said Whipple, "it's my treat. I want
                you to set out the best you've got for the boys, a glass
                around. This kind of a thing don't happen very often,
                you know."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Exceptions to all rules," commented Rorus. "Yes,
                I'll do it once, Whipple. It's like violating the
                constitution, that grand instrument, that bundle of wisdom,
                a heap in it, too. You can do that when it's a military
                necessity. This is a civil necessity."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There he is coming now," said Briggs, when the glasses
                which had been set out by Rorus had been drained. "But
                I wouldn't be too rough on him boys. I'd turn him
                over to the law."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No law to-day," replied the flaxen-whiskered man.

                CHAPTER XIX.<br>
                <small>THE VILLAGE HAS A SENSATION.</small>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The rain had quite dried from the withered grass in the
                road when Wrengell left the residence of Briggs. Some
                men in a meadow at the right were stirring hay, which
                would soon be fit to haul. In a field belonging to a farm
                adjoining, a reaper was doing the first work in harvest
                which John had seen that year.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was not until Wrengell entered Break o'Day that he
                bethought himself of his rough exterior. Had he considered
                in time, he would have gone through the fields, thus
                avoiding the village, but it was now too late to do so. Several
                loungers on the veranda of the hotel stared at him, and
                one of them put down his paper and spoke to the landlord
                about the mud-besmeared passer-by. John met Manie's
                friend, Miss Holmes, as she was coming from Birch &
                Bigney's store. She bowed pleasantly, but she was, he
                fancied, ashamed of their acquaintance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrengell was annoyed by the scrutiny of some men who
                were peering from a yellow building which bore the sign,
                I. J. H. Rorus. Their curiosity, which bordered on
                impertinence, was indicated by earnest gestures and one or
                two outstretched fingers which pointed directly toward him.
                Used, as he had been, to snubs, he was not accustomed to
                such insolent demonstrations; and he returned glances
                of defiance to the group at the door of the drug-store.
                His fearless demeanor prevented for a brief season the
                aggressive movement which was intended. The men
                stood parleying on the steps, some rhetorical, some
                argumentative, others fiercely denunciatory, each heedless of
                all opinions save his own, none succeeding in making
                himself well understood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Helloa, there," called Whipple, just as John had
                passed them. "What's your name?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The salutation was not the one most likely to propitiate
                an individual who considered that he had already been
                the subject of interest far too intense to be polite.
            </p>
            <p>
                "When I am satisfied that you have a right to demand
                an answer, I will give it," replied John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We'll see whether we have a right to question you,"
                said the flaxen-whiskered man, jumping from the steps.
                "Come on, boys. Now will you tell us what your name is?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," returned John. "Get out of my way, or I'll
                break some of your heads."
            </p>
            <p>
                "If I was in your place, I wouldn't be so cranky," said
                Briggs. "That colt that followed you out of the swamp last
                night was stole, and some of 'em think you took him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "If that is the case," said John, "I recognize your
                right to ask the question. Mr. Boyle knows me, do you
                not, Mr. Boyle?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I never saw you before," answered the sullen Alf, who
                had joined the throng.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why, I was at your house last night," protested John.
                "Mr. Durgenson introduced us."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You wasn't there last night, nor never," affirmed Alf;
                "anyway you never was when I was there."
            </p>
            <p>
                The crowd hooted and jostling against one another,
                endeavored to press closer to Wrengell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Grab him," yelled the flaxen-whiskered man.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was advantageous to John that his enemies were
                packed closely about him. Had they been excited by a
                rush, it is impossible to say what violence they would have
                done. The seizure was merely an extension of the
                captors' arms, to which John very quietly and sensibly
                submitted. Many who were unable to get near him picked
                up stones and clubs, staggered about and uttered loud
                threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is Dr. Rorus' drug-store," said John. "There
                is a man in there whom I know."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What did you say?" inquired Briggs. "They make
                so much noise. Keep still a minute, boys, can't you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell Loomis to come out," said John. "He knows
                me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Doctor," shouted Briggs, "where's Fred? This fellow
                says he knows him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Gone to Sharp town," said the doctor. "Won't be
                back till to-night. You had better confess this business,
                young man. The American people are a magnanimous
                people. They are a great people. Confess it, young man.
                If you do, Dr. Rorus is on your side. I tell you, when
                you've got him, you've got a host."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am one of Major Ratke's hired men," said John.
                "I have worked for him all summer and have formed
                some acquaintance, but none of them, except your clerk,
                live here."
            </p>
            <p>
                The crowd, gathered from the scum of Break o'Day
                and the surrounding country, was gesticulating, contending,
                threatening. There were, indeed, several who tried
                to protect the unfortunate Wrengell from the general wrath.
                Inoffensive Jimmy Martin mildly protested that they
                ought to give him "a show for his life." Keen contrition
                was felt by Briggs for the account which he had given of
                John's exit from the swamp. He had much exaggerated
                the facts, and the exaggeration was likely to result in
                the murder of a man whom he believed he had grossly
                wronged.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Boys," he called, "less see what he's got to say for
                himself. We don't want to hurt him till we find out
                whether he deserves it or not."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Take him down to the tree," said the flaxen-whiskered man.
            </p>
            <p>
                The party moved down the street to an oak, the spreading
                branches of which often afforded a shade to the villagers.
                Stakes had been driven, one under the tree, another
                a few paces from it, and around each had been worn
                depressions where the boys and men had pitched quoits.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where's a rope?" called Boyle. "Somebody git a
                rope."
            </p>
            <p>
                Half the mob started up the village, leaving the rest to
                guard Wrengell. John saw no hope of rescue.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the besotted, reddened faces around him was neither
                judgment nor mercy. Those who were least intoxicated
                were almost invariably hardest of heart by nature, and
                seemed to rejoice over the circumstances which had
                delivered the prisoner into their hands. Those who were
                naturally best disposed were, as a rule, too much overcome
                by drink to have an exact perception of justice. He
                resolved that, whatever pleasure they derived from his
                execution, they should not have the satisfaction of seeing him
                weaken at the last moment. He would die unflinchingly,
                without a word of entreaty. If the ruffians expected to
                witness his dejection or terror, they should be disappointed.
                If in the death-struggle his body yielded to the convulsions
                of expiring nature, it should be when it was no longer
                presided over by his will. To the south of him lay the swamp
                which he had been so anxious to leave. Its aspect, as he
                stood in the power of the brutal loungers, was far from
                forbidding to him. The tamaracks were in two phalanxes.
                In the first were the short trees with their conical figures,
                standing the advance guard of a mighty host. The next
                were of high stature, but irregular in form, their tops
                lacking the gradual taper which beautified those in the first
                body. Beyond these, like giants in the rear of a throng,
                were the upland woods, looking down on the outskirts of
                the hamlet, where savage men were arranging a spectacle
                both fascinating and revolting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Washington Street was in a tumult. A long inch rope
                had been obtained and grasped by many hands, was being
                carried to the intended gallows. Several business men of
                the town were accompanying the roughs and vainly
                expostulating on the precipitancy of their action. Wingscheut
                was with them, delivering a narrative only part of which
                could be distinguished above the uproar. John was about
                to reckon on a certificate of good character from his
                fellow-laborer, when he reflected that the German had
                mistrusted him of having secured his discharge from Ratke's.
                The vigilance of those about him had lessened. They
                had scattered and were intent on inspecting the body
                advancing with the rope. His left arm was clutched fiercely
                by Boyle; his right was held in an indifferent grasp by
                young Blake, who was between him and the tamaracks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly he jerked loose his right hand and planted it
                on the jaw of Boyle, who fell, momentarily stunned. As
                he whirled about, Blake quickly moved aside. The only
                one now in his way was Briggs; and his interviewer of
                the early morning, glad that he could partly nullify the
                effect of his misrepresentation, purposely stumbled over a
                Stone and allowed him to pass unmolested. Wrengell
                barely touched the fence in leaping it. With light feet
                and swift steps he ran toward the swamp, in the brush and
                quagmires of which he might find protection. The
                disappointed mob, uttering yell after yell of rage, started
                in pursuit. Among other cries John could plainly discern
                those of Wingscheut, who did not recognize the fugitive,
                "Cetch te tam horse-tief. Cetch te tam horse-tief."
            </p>
            <p>
                The distance between him and the rabble was increasing.
                He could not understand why they spread far to the
                left and right, unless it were to prevent him from escaping
                in either direction lengthwise of the swamp. The course
                which he took was undeviating. Some lazy cattle directly
                ahead of him dashed out of his way as he ran almost
                against them. Two men, one cradling and one binding,
                were at work in a small field of wheat on a southern
                slope. John raced straight through a few rods from them,
                leaving a path of lodged grain behind him. The owner of
                the field, who was cradling, called to know "why in the
                name of all possessed he was trampin' down his wheat."
                Undaunted by this inquiry, Wrengell descended the hill
                and passed into the shelter of some willow bushes, where
                he moderated his pace to a walk. Although this was the
                asylum which he had sought, he was impatient at the
                impediments to his progress and more uneasy that when he
                could watch the movements of his enemies. He felt relieved
                as he entered the body of low tamaracks which he had
                viewed from Break o'Day. But he could not stop there.
                Every jungle, every fallen tree-top, in fact every foot of
                ground was liable carefully to be searched. In the large
                tamaracks, where there was less underbrush, he went
                with more rapidity.
            </p>
            <p>
                A gleam of water was before him. He was nearing a
                lake, which with an area of half a section effectually barred
                his advance. The sound of voices at his right prevented
                him from wheeling and skirting along the bank. He, without
                practice as a swimmer, was on a point of land surrounded
                by the water and his foes. In his pocket was a revolver
                which he had obtained in a trade with Daggett,
                a cheap, rusted weapon, the cylinder of which had to be
                turned by hand each time it was fired. His pursuers,
                almost in sight, were crashing through the swamp. He had
                decided to turn, draw his revolver and stake his chance
                of escape on one determined charge, when across the point
                of land, through the thin growth of trees, he discovered a
                boat. Not a minute did he occupy in crossing the cape,
                but rapid as was his progress, it did not bring him first on
                the spot which he wished to reach. Young Blake and a
                companion gained the dock, barely in advance of him,
                and stood, panting, to intercept his flight. With a
                flourish of his revolver he dashed at the young men, who
                scrambled precipitately to land, unheeding water, mud
                and reputation for courage. John's haste was nearly as
                great as that of the foes whom he had frightened.
                Slipping on the narrow dock, which was composed of a few
                poles, he fell into the water, regaining his footing as Alf
                Boyle emerged from the tamaracks. To his discomfiture
                he found the boat locked. He must act with decision,
                for a reinforcement of roughs was but a few rods distant.
                He seized the chain and pulled with his entire strength,
                but the fastening remained secure. In desperation he
                clutched a paddle and pushed. The chain straightened,
                the lock gave way; the momentum had accomplished what
                the steady force could not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alf in the mean time had traversed the dock. His eye,
                which the night before had avoided John, was now fixed
                upon him with a brute ferocity. Seeing the boat sheering
                away from him, he sprang into the lake and grasped
                its gunwale, nearly overturning it. At the instant he was
                raising himself to clamber on board, he received from
                John's paddle a blow on the head, which loosened his
                hold and obliged him to seize the dock to keep from
                sinking. Several young men leaped into the lake, but they
                were kept from a near approach to John by the splashing
                of water into their faces and the sight of the paddle,
                which was menacingly uplifted. The gathering mob cast
                curses and sticks at the fugitive, but the demonstrations
                only showed their present impotence to do him harm. It
                was fortunate for John that there were no fire-arms among
                them; for, had they possessed them, they certainly would
                not have hesitated to use them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrengell, perspiring and fatigued from his long run, did
                not feel at liberty to pause. He did, however, wait long
                enough to remove his coat and vest, which had much impeded
                his flight. Near the opposite shore and a considerable
                distance apart were two boats laden with fishermen. After
                repealed signaling and shouting they understood that they
                were expected to stop an escaping horse thief. They
                unfastened the chains from the anchoring poles and
                guided their vessels so as to bring them across
                Wrengell's route. In an emergency rashness is sometimes
                safer than caution. John altered his course, steering
                directly for the nearer craft. Amazed at his audacity, the
                fishermen slackened their speed. Wrengell was within what
                he considered good rifle range when, turning the rusted
                cylinder of his revolver and elevating the muzzle, he fired.
                He was little practiced and had no dexterity in pistol-shooting,
                but to his astonishment and their dismay, the
                bullet struck close to the prow of the foremost boat. Careful
                to turn the weapon slightly to one side, he fired a
                second time; and the missile, whizzing past them, struck
                the water with a cutting plunge. The paddles which propelled
                the craft stopped moving, and the occupants looked
                from one to another in mute inquiry. While they were
                deliberating, Wrengell pulled toward them as if he were
                anxious for an encounter. Convinced that they were
                dealing with one of the most bloodthirsty of horse-thieves,
                who was bent on slaughtering the entire party, they paddled
                manfully to the eastern end of the lake. Those in the
                second boat, finding themselves unsupported, made off in
                the direction of the western extremity. The crafts skirted
                the opposite ends of the lake, so as to be well out of
                reach of the dreaded outlaw, and in response to the frantic
                shouting and waving of hats crossed over to transport
                the crowd at the dock.
            </p>
            <p>
                John strengthened the impression which he had made
                by sending after them two more shots. He then struck
                out for the southern shore, where he halted a moment to
                rest. The fishermen were making their best time to relieve
                the impatience of the waiting party. Messages were
                yelled back and forth, but most of them came from the
                shore, for the men on the water were putting forth too
                much other exertion to indulge freely in vocalization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrengell threw his coat and vest into the tall grass, and
                after a short pause continued his way. The swamp at
                this place offered no security. Above or below him he
                believed it to be denser and he determined to go to the
                eastward, away from the rabble of Break o'Day, away
                from the only community which had ever really respected
                him, away from the woman whom he loved, whose love
                he had hoped to secure. His appearance with the colt
                at Briggs' at such an hour and in such a condition, his
                refusal to tell his identity at the village, the absence of
                the slightest evidence to explain his whereabouts during
                the latter portion of the night must tell heavily against
                him should an accusation be preferred. He had shown
                the bearing of a hardened desperado. He had turned
                savagely on those who sought to retake him, as if he had
                become accustomed to conflicts in following unlawful
                occupations. He had fired upon and barely missed inoffensive
                fishermen, whose only aggressiveness to him had been
                that with no hostile demonstration they had presumed to
                come within range of his revolver. His dreams of
                respectability were dissipated. The public would inquire
                about his antecedents, and his miserable parentage would
                be made known. With his deformed foot, with the
                criminal record of his father and his mother, with his own
                perpetuity of the family reputation for felony how could
                he win esteem? He decided to go to the higher ground,
                which, because of its superior footing, he would follow for
                several miles, returning to the swamp when he had
                traversed that space.
            </p>
            <p>
                A short walk brought him to the elevated forest which
                he had viewed from the village. He was on the watershed
                of the lower Michigan peninsula. The lake which
                he had crossed was one of a series emptying through Huron
                River into Erie. The streams on the opposite side of the
                table-land went westward and, passing around Mackinac
                through the upper part of the great lake-chain, arrived at
                the same destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wide spaces between the high tamaracks below
                John allowed him to see the surface of the water, which
                was hardly disturbed by a ripple. The boats had started
                to recross. Filled with excited men and impelled by
                clumsy substitutes for oars, including poles and boards,
                they veered from side to side as the misdirected efforts of
                the rival paddlers alternately prevailed.
            </p>
            <p>
                John started through the woods on a trot, which he
                intended to maintain for an hour. He had no apprehension
                that they would immediately overtake him, for he had
                fairly outrun them at the beginning of the race. His
                greatest fear was that some of them would procure horses
                and, proceeding along the road, head him off, after which
                they would make a diligent search. He arrived presently
                at a field, which he deemed it injudicious to cross. In
                order to avoid exposing himself to view he was obliged to
                sheer farther from the swamp, passing along the edge of
                the timber. The field at his left gave place to a growth
                of bushes and small trees. Not exactly liking the route
                which he had chosen, he climbed a fence for the purpose
                of entering the thicket. He stood a moment on the top
                rail, listening for the sounds of pursuit. As he was about
                to descend, the rotten rail broke and he was precipitated
                heavily to the ground. He strove to rise, but a sharp
                pain shot through his ankle, which refused to bear his
                weight. He was crippled and defenseless, and near
                him were enemies who, if they were before relentless, were
                now exasperated. He had fallen at the edge of a blackberry
                thicket, the paths of which at frequent intervals indicated
                that the place was much visited. In the hope of finding
                a jungle which might screen him, he crawled for a few
                feet, but the briars which pierced his hands soon induced
                him to try another mode of travel. His next experiment
                was hopping, which had also its disadvantages. The
                bushes caught in his clothes, threw him off his balance,
                and aggravated the pain in his injured limb. He again
                went on his hands and knees, regardless of the injury to
                his flesh. As he was thus advancing, he came without
                warning near a woman, who with her back toward him
                was picking berries.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the intention of silently stealing away he partly
                arose and was about to execute his purpose, when the
                berry-picker, hearing a slight noise, turned around and
                faced him. An exclamation of surprise, which bordered
                on alarm, burst from the woman, who was Mrs. Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                But she quickly recovered her composure as she perceived
                that her rough-looking visitor was the young man in whom
                she had been so interested the preceding night. Her
                countenance expressed some displeasure, which
                undoubtedly arose from her inability to understand why
                Wrengell should use such secrecy in his approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They are after me!" exclaimed John, "a crowd of
                drunken men! They think I am a horse-thief! You can
                hear them in the woods yonder."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They are coming," said Mrs. Boyle, in a frenzied
                manner. "I don't know where you can hide. What shall we
                do? Oh, dear! What shall we do?"
            </p>

            <p>
                "Quick!", said Mrs. Boyle. "They'll be here in a few
                minutes. I know where you can hide. Come on. Oh,
                dear! You can't come. Lean on my shoulder."
            </p>
            <p>
                With the help of Mrs. Boyle John made his way through
                the bushes. His lame ankle was frequently twisted in
                his haste. The briars scratched the hands and faces both
                of him and of his companion. She conducted him to a
                brush pile which was nearly grown over with running
                blackberry vines; and letting go his arm, she threw back
                the trailing cover from the dry sticks and leaves, among
                which she hastily prepared a place for his reception.
                John lay down on the heap, where he was covered by the
                brush which Mrs. Boyle had removed and lastly by the
                long vines, the meshes of which made the signs of the
                disturbance less conspicuous.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're right here," said the lady hurriedly. "I'll run
                to the house and stay till they've gone, and then I'll
                come back."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Boyle hastened to the house, which she began to
                sweep. While she was thus engaged, Alf, with several
                companions, came to the door. Their faces were red,
                their coats and vests had been taken off, their shirts
                were drenched with perspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Have you seen a feller go by here?" inquired Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What kind of looking man?" asked Mrs. Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't care a --- what kind of a lookin' feller,"
                returned Alf. "Have you seen anybody go by?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I haven't," said Mrs. Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Some folks never see nothin'," said Alf, as he started
                away. "Come on, boys. He's gone on, I guess."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Will you be back to dinner, Alfred?" inquired Mrs.
                Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Tain't none o' your bisness when I'll be back," answered
                Alf." I ain't no little boy that's bound to give
                an account for every step I take."
            </p>
            <p>
                Other men shortly followed, scattering along as they
                varied in the respective qualities of speed, endurance and
                determination. It was more than an hour before all the
                stragglers had passed the house. Those who were last
                had waited for the third trips of the fishing-boats, or had
                been delayed by going around the lake. As soon as Mrs.
                Boyle considered it safe to do so, she went to the
                hiding-place where she had left Wrengell. She wondered, when
                she reached the spot, that it had not been marked by the
                pursuing parties. The vines had been drawn over the
                brush with such haste that some of them were turned
                with the berries and upper sides of the leaves down.
                She removed the covering and assisted John to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You must have thought I would never come," she
                said. "They were so long in going by I didn't dare try
                it before. You see I've brought you some crutches.
                They may be too short for you, but I think you can use
                them. Alfred had them when he cut his foot. We will
                go to the house now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It will not do for me to go there," said John. "They
                will certainly find me if I do. How could I stay in the
                house with your son without being discovered?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can't stay here," returned Mrs. Boyle. "They'll
                be back, and they'll hunt these brush all through. They
                won't think of looking for you in the house. Alfred
                doesn't stay there much. Sometimes he's away a week
                at a time. You can go up into the loft. There are no
                stairs and we never go up there; that is, we haven't been
                up for six months. Alfred got mad one time and he left
                the ladder up there. You see, there's nothing else you
                can do. You can't lie on the ground with that lame
                ankle, and besides, you'd be caught."
            </p>
            <p>
                These arguments were convincing to John. In a few
                minutes he was in the loft. After his ascent, Mrs. Boyle
                thrust a chair through the opening, bidding him, as he
                valued his safety to maintain perfect silence. She then
                directed John to draw up the ladder, and prepared to build
                a fire. The roof of the chamber was unsealed. Its inner
                portion was covered with rough boards, some of which
                were slabs. Built along them at frequent intervals, were
                wasp-nests whose dwellers were buzzing about the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a few minutes Mrs, Boyle appeared, "We must
                have your boot off," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have tried that," replied John, "but it will not
                come."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We will have to cut it loose," said Mrs. Boyle. "Let
                me take your knife now, please."
            </p>
            <p>
                With the knife she cut stitches and leather, and in a
                short time she gently removed the boot. She thought it
                advisable also to strip loose the stocking in the same way.
                The deformed foot was badly swollen. The sixth toe, the
                sole constituent of the deformity, was a squat, dwarfish
                body, sticking from an extensive puff. John, wearied by
                his long run and racked by suffering, was yet morbidly
                sensitive to an exposure of the misshapen part. Mrs,
                Boyle applied hot cloths to the injured ankle and handed
                him a bottle of camphor for application. She did not
                wound his feelings by an allusion to the malformation,
                nor did she appear to notice it. John could not explain
                her indifference to so unusual a sight. It argued either
                that she had perfect control over her actions, or that she
                had previously known of his misfortune.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I see you haven't any coat or vest," said Mrs. Boyle.
                "Where did you leave them?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "In the grass on this side of the lake," answered John.
                "I was very warm and I could run better with them off,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Up by the dock where you can find them when you
                get well?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "About two or three rods from it, I threw them near
                a large tree, and I will have no trouble in finding
                them."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am afraid it will be a long time before you can
                walk," said Mrs. Boyle. "You will have a tedious time
                of it. Be careful and don't wrench your ankle in the
                least. It will get well a great deal sooner provided you
                keep it perfectly still. I'll bring up your dinner now and
                mine, too, I didn't eat much when Alfred was here."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you not afraid of eating with a horse-thief?"
                asked John.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," returned Mrs. Boyle, "you never stole horses.
                As soon as you feel strong enough, you must tell me how
                they came to accuse you of any such thing. They are
                almost all miserable men that I saw go by, --- I mean the
                ones that I am acquainted with. I knew five or six of
                them, and only two are what people call good citizens."
            </p>
            <p>
                John was cautioned by Mrs. Boyle not to get so close
                to a window as to be visible to a person outside. While
                they were eating, and while she kept watch on the
                several avenues by which the house was likely to be
                approached, he related a part of the adventures which he
                had experienced since they parted after their first meeting.
                He did not reveal the identity of the Wallaces, or
                allude to their conversation respecting Montcalm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is a disgrace," said Mrs. Boyle, "that Dr. Rorus
                will drink and sell liquor so. He used to be called a
                smart man when he kept sober, but drink has nearly
                ruined his mind and his practice. No one ever sees him
                now, except when he has been drinking. Break o' Day
                used to be a peaceful place. Now they have awful fights
                there, and drunken men are around all the time. There
                is a law against selling liquor, but nobody tries to put it
                in force, although every one but the drunkards complain.
                Once in a while I think it's my duty to make legal
                complaint, but I do dread it so, and then Alfred, you know,
                he is, well, quick-tempered, he would be mad. I am
                afraid I don't always do as I ought to, just because it
                isn't pleasant."
            </p>
            <p>
                John doubted that there was a just occasion for Mrs.
                Boyle's fear. He believed that she was incapable of
                committing a wrong act. He had never seen another
                countenance which had so much benignity, such an expression
                of self-forgetfulness and concern for the comfort
                of others. She kept a fire in the stove, and at intervals
                brought up hot water in which to dip the cloths for the
                swollen limb. Mrs. Boyle did not venture to eat supper
                with John in the loft. She was apprehensive lest Alf
                might change his mind and return when he was least
                expected. At sunset she carried a feather tick and some
                clothes to the chamber and arranged for John a comfortable
                bed, When this ws done, she descended; and
                a few seconds later John heard her leave the house.
                Her absence was continued for an hour, but finally she
                reappeared in the loft with a bundle under her arm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am mad," said John. "You have been to the lake
                after my coat and vest. You have worked so hard that
                you ought not to have gone down there, tramping
                through the grass."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It did not hurt me in the least," said Mrs. Boyle. "I
                found them in five minutes."
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrengell had reason to be thankful. He had escaped
                a vindictive mob, and if he had sustained injury, he had
                fallen into the hands of a good Samaritan who had dressed
                his wounds and paid his reckoning at an inn. Unused
                to sleeping among the strange noises which pervaded
                the forest, he lay awake the greater portion of the night.
                He heard, oft repeated, the hooting of an owl, Sometimes
                distant, sometimes near, always monotonous. more
                interesting to him, because he did not know their origin,
                were the cries of two raccoons which were calling to each
                other from different parts of the wood.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was after daylight when he awoke from one brief
                nap which he had obtained. The wasps were humming
                about the apartment. Below, Mrs Boyle was stepping
                about briskly preparing breakfast. John was in no hurry
                to rise, for he lacked a profitable occupation. He lay
                long looking up at the rough roof boards, on the surface
                of which were dark weather-stains and those rings which
                record the years of the oak. His left leg was useless for
                purposes of travel. He dressed, took his crutches and,
                heedless of the injunctions which Mrs. Boyle had given
                him, opened a window and leaned half his body outside.
                The clearing was bounded on two sides by brush. These
                surroundings might have been forbidding had they not
                been before a background of fine timber. Some
                industrious man had chopped off a considerable amount of
                ground. John reached the conclusion that her son was
                adverse to using the ax and the brush-hook.
            </p>
            <p>
                The window where Wrengell was seated looked out on
                a fine stretch of wood. The trees, which were mostly of
                oak, were clad in the full magnificence of summer. An
                unusual number of them had large, straight trunks,
                running many feet high without a limb and surmounted by
                well-formed, wide-spreading tops.
            </p>
            <p>
                Near the edge of the timber a monster grape-vine was
                coiled about a sapling, nearly enveloping it and completely
                overspreading its branches at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tree was bent, as if its heavy burden had brought
                in youth the decrepitude of age. It was like some patient
                boy, who, deprived of recreation, sinks without a
                complaint under the weight of tasks, the endurance of which
                requires the strength of manhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                A black squirrel, apparently attracted by the infrequent
                spectacle, hopped leisurely to the sapling, which he
                proceeded to climb. He worked his way through, and
                seated on the top mat of vines, began earnestly to chatter.
                When he tired of this situation, he leaped to the limb of
                a large white oak and again sounded his calls. He was
                joined by another squirrel, which chased him round and
                round the body of the tree. The second arrival made
                only a short stay, but the first lingered after the departure
                of his companion. Going to the extreme end of a long
                limb which reached within a few feet of the house, he
                looked mischievously in at the window. John was pleased
                with the innocent gambols of the animal. He was about
                to push his head through the window, from which he had
                withdrawn, when the report of a gun rang out and the
                squirrel tumbled to the ground. As helplessly floundering,
                the little creature strove to escape, Alf rushed up and
                catching him by the tail struck his head several times
                against the tree. He continued the blows until the last
                shudder had passed through the inanimate frame.
            </p>
            <p>
                John, looking through a knot-hole in the side of the
                house, feared that Alf might see the open window and mis-
                trust the presence of a stranger. He knew by the brutality
                which he had so often witnessed that the ruffian, if
                he could avoid the penalties of the law, would delight in
                taking his life. After Alf had disappeared from his view,
                he crawled forward to let down the sash, but at that
                moment he heard his step below.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here's a squirrel, ma," said Boyle. "Can you cook
                him for breakfast?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I won't have time to dress him," replied Mrs. Boyle.
                "I'll cook him for dinner."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, you don't have time for nothin'," rejoined Alf.
                "It can't keep you very busy to cook for two. I won't
                be here to dinner. I s'pose, though, you can eat him ail
                yourself if you want to."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why can't you be here at dinner?" asked Mrs. Boyle.
                "Don't you think I ever get lonesome?"
            </p>

                The conversation between Alf and Mrs. Boyle was
                limited. As the young man was about to leave, he said;
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want a dollar."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't very well spare it," replied Mrs. Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I've got to have it," returned Alf. "They ain't no
                use o' talkin', I must have it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have use for it. It was only last Monday that I let
                you have two dollars,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "That ain't got nothin' to do with to-day. If I didn't
                need it, I wouldn't ask you. You might just as well git
                it as to fool around, for I won't be monkeyed with."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Boyle reluctantly procured the desired sum for
                Alf, who departed on receiving it. She looked troubled
                when she brought John his breakfast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrengell's quarters were tolerably comfortable. He had
                not, indeed, many luxuries. Mrs. Boyle furnished him a
                few books, but they were of a character such as, it must
                be confessed, is interesting to few young persons. They
                were religious works, treatises on piety, and biographies of
                religious people. A strong recommendation for perusing
                them, however, was the daily life of the woman by whom
                they were read. She was never idle, and rarely working
                for her own benefit. She daily visited the sick woman,
                Mrs. Blake, and John guessed that she carried her
                medicine, delicacies and staple provisions. There were,
                besides, others to who she ministered. She did not tell
                John of her charity, but he saw direct and circumstantial
                evidence to convince him that his surmises were correct.
                One afternoon a small boy came to her house and alluded
                to a coat which she had given him.
            </p>
            <p>
                John was awakened the fourth night after his arrival
                by the gruff voice of Alf in the lower room. The
                worthless fellow was repeating his demand for money, which
                Mrs. Boyle was resisting.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You want to know about every cent I spend," he said,
                "just as though I was a two-year-old young one. I
                thank you, I ain't tied to your apron-strings now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't give it to you to-night, Alfred," said Mrs.
                Boyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can't is a big word with you," said Alf. "That's
                what you say every time, but you manage to find money
                when you want to. I've got to have it to-night because
                I'm goin' away, I won't be back in a week, maybe
                never,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why, what have you been doing?" cried Mrs. Boyle,
                "You have got into trouble."
            </p>
            <p>
                "S'posin' I have," said Alf. "I can git out of it
                without consultin' you. You git what I want, and I'll manage
                the rest."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have let you have all I can," replied Mrs. Boyle.
                "I'm afraid you don't make good use of it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It don't make no difference what use I make of it,"
                returned Alf, "If you don't git it, I'll burn your ole
                shanty down. Now you can bet your boots on that."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is the Lord's," returned Mrs. Boyle firmly, "and
                I must keep it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then, if it's His, he hadn't ought to have it layin'
                round here," said the profane Alf.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, Alfred," cried the distressed woman, "how can
                you be so wicked?" I have tried to bring you up right
                and cried about you and give you more than I keep
                myself. But this I have promised to apply to the Lord's
                purpose. Don't talk so, and don't try to make me sin by
                breaking my promises!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Be you a-goin' to git me that money?" asked Alf.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said Mrs, Boyle, "it is God's and I must keep
                it."
            </p>
            <p>
                Alf was furious with rage. He uttered a savage oath,
                raised his fist, struck her a blow which sent her reeling
                against the wall and ran from the room. As soon as the
                dispute threatened a serous termination, John arose and
                began to dress. The blow from Alf's fist was struck
                just before Jig reach the opening which led below.
                Without waiting to use the ladder he lowered himself by
                his hands, falling in a heap on the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where has he gone?" cried John. "I will teach
                him better than that!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, stop John!" Mrs. Boyle pleaded, sobbing in
                spite of her efforts to be calm. "You mustn't say
                anything! You must keep still or he will kill you!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "But I will not keep still," replied John. "He struck
                you, and I will punish him. I will shoot him!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "What!" exclaimed Mrs. Boyle, "you wouldn't shoot
                my son?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "He is not your son," answered John. "No such
                mother ever had such a son."

            </h2>
            <p>
                The affair at Break o'Day caused more excitement
                than the murder of Green, and was the most notable event
                which had happened in the vicinity that season.
                Representatives of the Jackson and Ann Arbor Press visited
                the hamlet, which in a few weeks acquired more
                reputation than it had hitherto gained in half a century.
                From Wingscheut a reporter obtained a sensational and
                valuable budget of news. His paper stated that the valiant
                German had been fated singularly often to meet the
                horse-thieves, that in the spring he had an encounter
                with them when they were escaping with a horse at the
                barn of a farmer named Spartus, that in the swamp near
                Break o'Day he maintained, unarmed and unaided, a
                combat with four of them, and that, had he been properly
                supported, the entire gang might have been captured.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Jackson "Goad," a sheet published with the avowed
                purpose of prodding beyond endurance the party then in
                power, was especially active in making inquiries about
                Wrengell. It gave a highly colored account of the young
                man's sojourn at Ratke's. It dwelt minutely on his
                reticence respecting his former residence and occupation.
                It declared that a man unused to deeds of violence
                could never show such nerve and determination as he had
                manifested. It related how he had been detained by the
                order-loving citizens of Break o'Day, how he had broken
                loose from their restraint, knocking them right and left,
                how he had fearlessly charged upon and driven back a
                group of men at the dock, how he had sought an
                encounter with the boats and had done some phenomenally
                close shooting at Long range.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major was wroth at the wrong done his hired man.
                He visited Rorus and talked to him with such sternness
                that the doctor did not as usual reply in a long series of
                co-ordinate terms capped by an anti-climax. He told him
                that he should hold him responsible for the injury which
                Wrengell received, and that if one of his men ever again
                was subjected to so much as an affront at the drug-store,
                he would administer a personal castigation to its proprietor.
                Directly after the appearance of the exaggerated article in
                the "Goad" Ratke called on the editor and demanded that
                retraction be made at once. The next week the story
                was modified; but after it was shorn of its absolute
                untruths, it still bore strong testimony against Wrengell.
            </p>
            <p>
                The startling occurrences which agitated Ratke's
                neighbors did not keep him from the contemplation of his
                inventions. He had engaged an Oakville blacksmith to
                iron his Jerusalem wagon, which he decided to take in
                pieces and put on another vehicle for transportation. As
                the several parts were too heavy to be lifted easily by one
                man, he ordered Jake to assist him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I expect to create a sensation with my wagon in a few
                weeks, Jake," said the philosopher. "If it becomes
                famous, you can boast that you had a hand in preparing
                the first perfect model."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Put this 'ere rattletrap in the hind end?" asked Jake,
                as he picked up a pair of wheel-posts, seemingly
                unconscious of his honorable function.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, Jake," said the major, when he was ready to
                start to Oakville, "you may haul the wood which you and
                John sawed. I would like to be able to say that my
                inventions are used to a great extent on my farm. You may
                draw the wood with the Old Jerusalem. I intend to go
                to Jackson, and shall no doubt be gone until five o'clock."
            </p>
            <p>
                Jake had a special aversion to the products of his
                employer's genius. With rebellion in his heart he hitched a
                team to the Old Jerusalem. He had driven but a few
                rods when the reach came unfastened and letting one end
                of the box fall to the ground, slid him speedily down the
                smooth bottom boards. Many minutes were occupied in
                readjusting the detached parts. Impatient of delay, he
                climbed on the wagon and spoke sharply to the team, but
                the tongue with the whiffletrees was jerked loose, and he
                was nearly pulled from his position by the lines. The last
                accident intensified his disgust, which he had before
                restrained with difficulty. He hitched the horses to a
                pair of trucks, and with this equipment hauled the wood in
                the forenoon some hours sooner than the major thought
                the work would be completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke, who drove no farther than Oakville, returned to
                the farm at eleven o'clock. After caring for his team, he
                went to the field where Montcalm was at work.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Trace," said the major, "that article which you sent
                to the Indianapolis "Standard" will greatly benefit me.
                You described my wagon in fine terms. You could never
                I have obtained its insertion if you had not once been a
                reporter for the paper. Such an account coming from a
                distance will make me and my inventions respected more
                at home. A great name, to be acquired in one's own
                neighborhood, must be imported. We may call this the
                endosmose of reputation."
            </p>
            <p>
                In passing the barns Ratke noticed that the trucks
                were not in their accustomed place under a shed. His
                anger was kindled at sight of Jake, who was throwing off
                his last load of wood from another vehicle than the Old
                Jerusalem.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jake," said the displeased inventor, hurrying to the
                wood-pile, "I told you expressly to use the Old Jerusalem.
                Why did you take the trucks?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Cause," replied Sheppard, "I wanted to git done
                some time to-day. I didn't like to fuss."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I pay you for your time," returned Ratke. "When
                you do as I tell you, it is my lookout if your service is
                unprofitable. After this you use the tool I give you to work
                with."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't like no such 'rangement as the Jerus'lem,"
                rejoined Jake. "The ole thingumbob ain't good for
                nothin', an' never was."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jake," said the major, "it is not your place to question
                the wisdom of my plans. I am quite capable of directing
                my own affairs. Whenever you are unwilling to obey my
                instructions you may quit my employ."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I guess I better quit now," said Jake. "We never
                had no words till to-day, an' we never want none."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How much do I owe you?" inquired the major.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You ain't paid me nothin' for two years," answered
                Sheppard, "an' there's some back that I earnt afore
                that."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is that so?" ejaculated the major, ashamed that he
                was unable to pay his discharged hired man. "I will get
                it for you as soon as I can, Jake."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They gener'ly make reckonin' on payin' a man when
                they ship him," said Jake, "but you needn't be in no hurry
                about it. I'll let you know when I want it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Never mind throwing off the wood," said the major.
                "Come in to dinner. I will have Mark take care of the
                team."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm much obliged," returned Jake. "I'll take care of
                'em myself and finish up my job at the wood. I don't care
                for no dinner. I've et in that house for nine years, but
                'tain't likely I'll ever eat there agin."
            </p>
            <p>
                The major found visitors awaiting him in the house,
                Senator Mallard and Mrs. Baldwin, a sister of the statesman's
                deceased wife. Mallard's whole aspect was one of
                strength, both physical and mental. He was heavily built,
                though not corpulent. His face was smooth-shaven.
                His mouth was peculiarly expressive, indicating according
                to his mood, pleasure, approbation, sarcasm, disdain
                or wrath. His eyes were large and dark, and over them
                rose a brow which was broad and steep. While he was
                yet a young man, he had been prominent in state politics.
                Very soon after he had entered the United States Senate,
                he was ranked as a power in debate; and in a few years
                he was a recognized party leader. The idol of his friends,
                he was hated by many of his opponents whose opinions
                had been roughly handled by his aggressive speeches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The greeting between the old men was cordial. They
                had many questions to ask, answers to return and experiences
                to relate. Since their last meeting one had increased
                in wealth and influence, one had virtually lost his property,
                each had been bereft of a wife, and each had grown gray,
                though he had retained his bodily vigor. Mrs. Grippin
                had to repeat her summons to dinner several times before
                it was responded to by the major and his guest. Ratke
                quite forgot everything except his friend and the scenes
                through which they had mutually passed. He talked with
                such abstraction, as he waited on the visitors, that he was
                unfitted for his duty. He placed potatoes on the plate
                intended for Mrs. Baldwin, one at about every four words.
                He had the dish well rounded when he was stopped by
                Mrs. Grippin, and the second interference of his sister
                alone saved the vegetables from being deluged with a
                profuse quantity of gravy. After dinner he and Mallard
                went back of the house, where they seated themselves on
                the wood-pile and talked for half the afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, George," said the major, "I suppose you are
                confident of being re-elected in January."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am confident that I shall not again be re-elected,"
                replied Mallard. "For nearly forty years, with scarcely an
                intermission I have been a public servant. Now I have a
                right to demand that my condition shall be changed from
                serfdom to independence."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There are many who aspire to be tied with the bonds
                of national servitude," said the major. "The official has
                too much authority properly to be called a slave. He
                dictates to those whom you term his masters."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Neither all nor the greater part of political power,"
                returned Mallard, "is wielded by officials acting in an
                official capacity. Behind the officer is the will of the
                public, and behind that is the moulding influence of the
                Press and of those thinkers who study and expound
                matters of government. When the honest legislator
                finds that his conscience and popular sentiment are
                antagonistic, it is his duty to yield to the former; but be who
                habitually disregards the wishes of his constituents will
                soon destroy his political career."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The responsibility to constituents," said Ratke, "is
                our great safeguard against usurpation. Were it not for
                that, the Republican party would be wholly unscrupulous
                in its disregard of precedent. The organization of which
                you are a leader has repeatedly violated the constitution
                and is advocating principles which, if carried out, will
                eventually lead to monarchy."
            </p>
            <p>
                This provoked a spirited reply from Mallard, which in
                turn elicited a long answer from Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "James," called Mrs Grippin, "I'll have to have some
                wood now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "All right, Maria," said the major. "There is no
                warrant in the constitution for such dictatorial laws as
                have been enacted. Quote, if you can, a single passage
                which justifies them."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very well," answered Mallard, 'Congress shall have
                power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper
                for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all
                other powers vested by this constitution in the government
                of the United States, or in any department or officer
                thereof.' The specification in an instrument like the
                constitution of every power of a legislative body is quite
                impracticable, on account of the limited space in the
                instrument and the inability of its framers to tell with any
                certainty what exigencies may arise. This provision, had it
                not been inserted, would have to be assumed, for no
                government could long prosper without the ability to
                enact special laws."
            </p>
            <p>
                "James," said Mrs. Grippin, who was kept by the
                presence of her visitors from an outburst of passion, "I'm
                waiting for that wood."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You shall have it," answered Ratke, methodically
                picking up two sticks and advancing to the kitchen, 'To
                make all laws which shall be necessary and proper.' The
                Republican party ignores that word proper. It interprets
                the clause thus! 'To make such laws as best serve our
                partisan purposes,' An undue concentration of national
                authority," he continued, elevating his voice as he entered
                the kitchen, "is incompatible with good government.
                There should be a diffusion of power."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, dear! What a man!" exclaimed Mrs. Grippin.
                "Two sticks of wood to do a baking. Now you go right
                back and get me some wood."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can carry the larger load," said Mallard, laughing, as
                Ratke descended the back steps. "In our younger days
                we tried feats of strength, but I am not used to them
                now."
            </p>
            <p>
                Each man took in a huge armful of wood, and Mrs.
                Grippin was satisfied both with the quality and quantity
                of the supply. The housekeeper took pains to find several
                tasks for her brother, that the discussion might be, broken
                off and he might not be worsted by Mallard, for, though
                she professed great dislike of his argumentative habits,
                she was secretly proud of his proficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                "George," said the major, when they had left the house,
                "a great career is sometimes late in its commencement,
                is it not?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Certainly," responded Mallard, "history furnishes
                many such instances."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I believe," said Ratke, "that mine is about to begin.
                Did I tell you that I have turned a part of my attention
                to literature?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, indeed," answered the senator with some surprise.
                "Which one of the muses has captivated you? Are
                you pondering over the massive tomes of Themis, are you
                under the spell of Polyhymnia's rhetoric, or are you following
                the voice of Calliope as she leads you over fields,
                through forests and across lakes, by ancient earth works
                and mounds, in which are the relics of extinct races. This
                locality, I think, would furnish to a string imagination
                material for a grand epic."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your guess is incorrect," said Ratke. "The title of
                the work which I am writing is 'Nature Concordia
                Philospiæ Animi.' In two volumes I am undertaking to
                prove that every phenomenon of nature has a corresponding
                one in the human mind or soul. Volume one treats
                of the relativity of physics and metaphysics, volume two,
                of the relation of physical laws to the will and higher
                emotions. The moral treatise I finished first, more than
                a year ago, in fact.
            </p>
            <p>
                "In its preparation I was obliged to refer to no modern
                language except our own. English is rich in dissertations
                of the soul, but it furnishes little to the science of mental
                phenomena. In order to master the metaphysical part I
                was obliged to read a great deal in German. You know I
                am deficient in that language. I was helped in my reading
                by Manie and by Wrengell, the young fellow who made
                such a stir at Break o' Day."
            </p>
            <p>
                That night the old men sat up until after twelve o' clock
                talking of experiences which stretched through fifty years,
                of college days, of books which were but half remembered,
                of sports long unpracticed, but still unforgotten, of
                acquaintances, some of whom were living, some dead, some
                honored, some disgraced. Their faces kindled with
                fervor of youth, their tones and gestures were animated;
                they were no longer old. They laughed at ludicrous
                circumstances with greater zest than when they witnessed the
                incidents. Unrealized ambitions, triumphs in the lyceum
                and in class-room, petty dissensions with their fellows, they
                reviewed with minuteness which they could not have used
                in describing later events. At every visit since their
                graduation, they had gone over these same experiences. Each
                recital had exceeded its predecessor in the pleasure which
                it had imparted and the earnestness with which it had been
                delivered. Only three days before, Mallard had made in
                Chicago a great speech, which was destined to be published
                in the papers throughout the entire country and to be
                repeated in substance on the platform by the minor
                satellites of his party. Now his dignity was laid aside, he
                was mirthful, even boyish, in his actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                "George," said Ratke, "you remember that we confided
                our aspirations to each other. Mine have promised
                much, but yielded nothing. You have accomplished
                what you set out to accomplish. You must be a happy
                man."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You judge too hastily," returned Mallard. "I have
                money, I have a fair reputation, but I have
                been unfortunate in my family affairs. I had a wife, a
                perfect companion, one of the best helpmeets whom God
                ever gave to man. She is dead. I had a son, gifted and
                promising. I kept him at school and gave him every
                advantage. He excelled in his studies. He had a
                special liking for rhetoric and argument. I meant to train
                him to be a statesman. I believed that he would exceed
                me in fame and power as Alexander exceeded Philip.
                But he took to drink. He died a disgraceful death, and
                the world knows my shame. I had a daughter who was
                as amiable as she was beautiful and accomplished. After
                the death of my wife and son, she was my idol. For a year
                she took music lessons at Detroit. When she came home,
                she told me about some attentions which had been paid
                her by a young foreigner, a German. I cautioned her to
                accept no more of his addresses until I had seen him.
                One day I was discussing the slavery question with some
                gentlemen in a hotel. You know before the war I was
                not in favor of immediate abolition, I was advocating the
                principles of the Republican party, when a young abolitionist
                commenced to talk in the most fanatical manner. I
                answered him, and he returned a torrent of abuse. Saying
                that I had no wish to discuss a question with one who
                substituted invective for argument, I left him. A few
                days after this occurrence I opened the door of my house
                and found in the parlor the young man who had treated me
                so rudely in the hotel. I bade him go and never enter my
                dwelling again. I asked Eliza if this impudent German
                was her suitor. She said he was. I told her to hold no
                communication with him, that if she did, she could no
                longer stay under the protection of my roof. A week
                after that they eloped. I made no attempt to follow them,
                but Eliza wrote me that they had gone to Detroit, and the
                newspapers, of course, tracked them up and put in every
                mouth the story of my new disgrace. I would have
                welcomed them back had it not been for my positive declaration
                that I would not do so. I heard nothing more of
                them until my sister-in-law found an item in a paper
                which stated that they had been killed two months previously
                in a railroad accident at Chicago. An enterprising reporter
                had had his attention riveted by the names of
                the victims, as they appeared in an old paper and had dis-
                covered that they were the same which had been borne
                by my son-in-law and daughter. The surmise of the reporter
                was correct. I took up the bodies, which are now
                in the Lansing cemetery. Never measure happiness by
                fame or apparent success."
            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning the major to no avail urged his
                guests to prolong their visit. He did, however, extract a
                promise that Mallard would make a more extended stay
                the succeeding summer. As the senator and Mrs, Baldwin
                were at the gate taking leave of the Ratkes, Panicky
                came trudging up with his satchels.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good morning, Senator," was the peddler's familiar
                salutation. "How do you come on?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very well," answered Mallard. "How is your health,
                Mr. Dabney?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Extra," said Panicky. "I am exposed enough to kill
                three common men, but I know what to take to keep me
                healthy. What's the reason I can't ride with you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can as well as not," replied Mallard, "if you can
                sit in the back of the buggy and let your feet hang behind.
                It is an uncomfortable way of riding, but it is the best I
                can provide for you, Mr. Dabney."
            </p>
            <p>
                "James," said the senator, "we are old men. We can
                not tell when we shall next meet. It may be in another
                world."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope you will come back again soon," said Ratke
                as they shook hands at parting. "If you do not of your
                own accord, I hope circumstances will bring you back."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wish I had such a team as that," remarked Panicky,
                when they were on their way. "I wouldn't be ramping
                through the country as I am now. I know what to give
                'em to keep 'em in good trim."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You sold me some panacea for them, Dabney," said
                Mallard with a smile. "I have at home all the medicine
                I can possibly use."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You hauled 'em over the coals good at Chicago," said
                Panicky. "That speech ought to be in the house of every
                Republican, and every Democrat, for that matter. If If
                could hear you get off the same thing at Lansing, I'd give
                all there is in my satchels to some hospital. The Democratic
                papers make as big a fuss about that as the doctors
                do about the Great American Panacea."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why did you not stop at Ratke's?" inquired the
                senator. "I should think you would try to make a sale
                at every house."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes, I do," said Panicky, "but I was over this
                road just a little while ago. I'm going to turn off up hovered
                past Takum's. I don't have to peddle the panacea much.
                It sells itself."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mallard's team was young and spirited. Constantly on
                the alert for objects by which they might be frightened,
                the horses lifted their heads high and drew the buggy
                along at a sharp pace. In the road near Takum's house
                were playing some children, some of whom were so nearly
                of a size that there was no perceptible difference in their
                ages. They were seated, or squatted, exactly in the track,
                and they moved aside reluctantly to make way for the
                travelers. One little girl, who used her apron as a
                receptacle of sand, pulled the garment over her face and
                suddenly rising, jerked it down, throwing a cloud of dust
                almost against the fractious team. The horses jumped
                forward, determined to flee from the unwonted spectacle.
                They were in a fair way to be quieted when the whole
                troop of Takum's dogs, large and small, came bounding
                toward them with yelps and barks. They still would have
                been manageable by Mallard's strong arm had not accident
                aided them in their insubordination. The left-line
                snapped in twain, the unbalanced right pulled them to one
                side, a front wheel struck a large stone, and the buggy
                was overturned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Panicky was whirled over in a summersault, his satchels,
                bumping and jingling, rolled down an incline, where one
                of them flew open; his knee struck a small stump which
                was inconveniently near. He groaned dismally for a moment;
                then, raising himself, began to wail: "Oh, dear!
                Oh, gosh! Oh, Jerusha! Oh, I'm dying! I'm dying!
                I'm dying!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs, Baldwin was unhurt. She turned at once to the
                assistance of her brother-in-law, whose form was stretched
                at full length, motionless and apparently lifeless. She
                lifted his head, she rubbed his hands, she called his name.
                His closed eyes did not open, he gave no sign of realizing
                her attentions. The Ratke family and Brown ran as soon
                as possible to the scene of the accident, Nora in advance
                of them all. They carried the senseless statesman back
                to the house which he had thought he might not again
                visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitterly did Ratke regret his expressed wish that, with
                or against his will. Mallard would soon return. The
                stalwart frame, the hands he had pressed in farewell, the
                features, the changes of which he had watched in controversy
                and shared in the revival of memories had, indeed,
                come back; but tied in the bonds of inertness, they could
                not return his words or feelings. He found, however, that
                his friend was not dead. In the course of an hour he had
                the satisfaction of seeing him sit up and of hearing him
                announce that he felt better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Daggett was in the tamaracks by the road cutting poles
                when his attention was drawn by the sound of rapidly
                approaching hoofs. Dropping his ax, he rushed to the,
                highway just in time to catch the runaway team. With some
                trouble he allayed their excitement and drove them back
                toward Ratke's. The overturned buggy and the groaning
                peddler were sufficient to explain the catastrophe.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Helloa! What's up?" he exclaimed, as he neared
                Panicky, who was seated on the ground, holding his knee
                and rocking back and forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I'm about dead!" moaned Panicky. "I'm fixed!
                My leg's broke! I know it is! Oh, that's awful! You
                don't know how I suffer! Oh, I'm laid up for life! Oh,
                I won't do another tap of work for six months!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am agent for the Great American Panacea," said Daggett,
                advancing with a broken bottle, which had been left
                with the fractured part upward, so that it still retained a
                portion of its contents. "This medicine is compounded of pine,
                hemlock, tamarack, cedar and spruce, besides sovereign
                roots and herbs known to the medical fraternity. It cures
                cuts, bruises, sprains, wounds, incisions and all injuries to
                the flesh. It is also a sovereign remedy for asthma,
                bronchitis, tonsilitis, laryngitis and all throat diseases,
                besides being an excellent tonic for consumption, dyspepsia,
                liver-complaint, rheumatism, malaria, fever and
                ague"
            </p>
            <p>
                "If your knee was like mine, you wouldn't make fun
                of it," returned Panicky. "Oh, the whole top of my
                knee's smashed! Oh, I won't do another tap of work for
                two months!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes, you will," assured Daggett, "I'll have you
                on your feet in no time, I know a fellow over in Ingham,
                a log rolled over his leg, smashed the whole business fine,
                bones, skin, flesh and all. The doctor, he come
                to amputate it, but I got him to try a bottle of the panacea.
                Well, the next week was the Fourth of July, and he
                took the first prize for running at Lansing, and just a
                little while afterward he beat the best mile record by three
                seconds. Have a bottle, Mister. It isn't panicky. Panacea,
                sir, panacea. Panicky is where they get in a battle,
                you know."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I guess I will rub some of the panacea on my knee,
                said the peddler, taking the broken bottle with a grin.
                "That feels a good deal better," he acknowledged, as he
                arose after applying his medicine. "It beats all how
                quickly it helps it," he said, limping to his satchels and
                beginning to gather up the uninjured portion of his wares.
                "You'll know just what to do for lameness," he concluded,
                when with the strap over his shoulder connecting the two
                burdens, he was limping around the corner.

                Before the arrival of doctor Rorus, for whom the major
                had sent. Mallard declared that he was able to recommence
                his journey. Ratke protested, but to no avail.
                He did, however, induce the senator to take the cars at
                Barton Junction and allow Daggett, whom he considered a
                fair horseman, to drive the team to Lansing.

                The dry weather continued. In the memory of the
                oldest inhabitant there had not been so long an interval
                without rain. Cattle and sheep sought the protection of
                shade. Stunted and withered, the corn leaves rolled
                upward to hold the scanty supply of dew which fell, but it
                was sucked away by the sun; and their need of drink
                was still unfurnished. In the road timothy and June
                grass were dried and lopped over. Other grass, withered
                before maturity, was laid flat and thickly powdered with
                sand, yellow along its blades, showing green near its
                roots, even through its veil of dirt. Clouds of dust were
                almost continually in motion, coming from the wheels of
                passing vehicles and from drags and cultivators at work
                on the moistureless summer fallows. The smell of burning
                marshes was in the air. Fire, started accidentally or
                thoughtlessly, was running here and there through the
                country, uniting with the drought to render unavailing their
                farmer's toil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effect of the fire and dust was to level distinctions
                of color in nature. Vegetation was draped in dirt; so
                that grass and tree, plowed field and meadow, all
                approached the same faded hue. The atmosphere seemed
                to share the general taint, as if the eye were constantly
                looking through a dust-smeared glass. Over and among
                the woods hung a haze of smoke, a connecting shade
                between cerulean and green, which made less marked their
                division where the tree-tops cut an irregular border in the
                sky.

                Northern Michigan had been blazing. Thousands of
                families were homeless. For these sufferers subscriptions
                had been raised to which the people had liberally
                contributed. Then a great smoke arose from Oakville; and
                when it cleared, half the village had been consumed.
                Again the subscription was passed around, but this time
                it met with poorer success. A fortunate merchant who
                had escaped without loss visited Ratke as a solicitor for
                his fellow-townsmen. The major had just threshed a
                part of his wheat and had in his pocket forty dollars which
                he was to pay to the Enterprise Machine Company of
                Chicago, The note was due, and his impatient creditors
                had threatened him. "They can wait," he said. "Our
                neighbors cannot wait. Take it, Marsh, I wish I had
                more for you."

                Montcalm had announced his intention to quit farm
                labor. It was with reluctance that his employer saw him
                take the train at Barton Junction.

                July twenty-third was long a day of anticipation to
                Ratke, On that day he must deed away in Sharptown the
                Barton hundred and sixty in order to satisfy Durgenson,
                who, he feared, would drive him from his old farm. On
                that day he was to meet in the same town a man who with
                a view to purchasing would examine the New Jerusalem.
                As was related in the preceding chapter, an account of
                the invention had been published in the Indianapolis
                Standard, and shortly after a letter had come to the major
                from Madgeburg, Indiana, stating that a representative of
                the wagon-works in that city would be in Sharptown the
                twenty-third, and that, if Major Ratke would meet him at
                the Cass House, they might negotiate a sale. The letter
                was signed J. Boutwell, president. On the note-head was
                printed J. Boutwell, President; T. C. Parker, Treasurer.

                "Fortune is with me, Maria," said the philosopher.
                "The Madgeburg wagon works are among the -largest in
                the country. If they believe the New Jerusalem is
                a success, fifty thousand dollars is no price for it. Its
                value once proven, it will take everything by storm. I
                would rather have a percentage on the sales than to sell
                for cash."

                "Well, that man is a fool," remarked Mrs. Grippin.
                "That's all I've got to say about him. He isn't fit to be
                president of any wagon company."

                The major order Daggett to harness Taylor and Bill
            </p>
            <p>
                to the New Jerusalem. With approbation he looked over
                its low boxes and its high posts and wheels. He had
                taken it from the shop still unpainted because it would
                not have time to dry before it went to Sharptown for
                examination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seated in the bottom of the front box, he drove out of
                his yard with his head not five feel from the ground.
                Behind him was the second box, which was empty. On
                either side of each six-foot wheel and towering still afoot
                higher, was a post connected by a board with its mate at
                the top. The wheels had been favored with limited provisions
                for greasing; and one of them emitted at every
                revolution three squeaks, the first two short and spirited,
                the last dolorous and prolonged.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major's neighbors did not gratify him by manifesting
                surprise. But, as he drove into Break o'Day, he and
                his conveyance created something of a sensation. Some
                of the citizens came out and delighted him by making
                minute inquiries. The boys were especially pleased with
                the novel exhibition. As the wagon started, several of
                them imitated the three squeaks of the noisy hind wheel
                with tolerable accuracy. But their companions remembering
                the peanuts and candy which the kind-hearted
                philosopher had given them, obliged them to desist from
                the annoyance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ride from Break o' Day to Sharptown was one of
                victorious pomp, and the New Jerusalem a triumphal car.
                All along the route the squeaking hind wheel summoned
                hosts of spectators. There was no boy who did not
                suspend his play, no woman whose face was not pressed
                close to a window or thrust through a door, no man who
                did not pause in his work and follow the wonderful sight
                with his eye until it had receded far up the road, taking
                with it, after it had passed from view, its wailing squeak.
                Through the windows of one school-house appeared the
                upstretched heads of the pupils, and the teacher, although
                disapproving of their conduct, was careful to stand where
                she could hear her class without taking her gaze from the
                old man who was huddled in a low box half-hidden by
                posts and wheels. At the next school-housel the pupils
                were having recess. He invited them to ride; and two of
                the boys, unheeding the bell, went with him for a mile.
                The driver on the power of a threshing-machine near the
                road yelled vociferously at his horses until they stopped.
                The gang of hands left their places to examine the new
                wonder. The major obtained an oil can from the driver
                and endeavored to grease the wheels of his wagon, but
                the closely fitting posts would not allow him properly to
                apply the oil.
            </p>
            <p>
                No interest which he had aroused was worthy of comparison
                with that which he awakened in Sharptown. The
                central portion of the town, which contained two thousand
                inhabitants, was situated on the crest of a gradual slope.
                When Ratke entered the outskirts, several pedestrians
                were walking along the one side of the street which had a
                sidewalk. This number received additions from the
                houses and from the cross-streets. Farther on there was
                a walk on either side, and the throng divided and
                increased. Numbers from upper town observing the
                slow-moving procession, met and turning, joined the tide
                which, made up of footmen, horses and vehicles, filled
                the sidewalks and the street and confined travel to one
                direction.
            </p>

                A philosophic Scipio, the major leaned back in his car
                and viewed the homage which the gaping multitude unwittingly
                tendered him. He remembered that Scipio had
                fallen from appreciation, and he preferred, therefore, to
                compare himself to Caesar. Before him was a common
                wagon loaded with wheat. Anciently the conquered foe
                walked before the conqueror, "Likewise," thought Ratke,
                "the common wagon goes before the New Jerusalem,
                which is destined soon to sweep it completely out of use."
            </p>
            <p>
                The greatest incongruity in his position was that he
                was very low for a conquering hero. The horses obscured
                his vision, and he was obliged to twist his head to one
                side in order to see his wagon's vanquished rival jolting
                along through the dust, unconscious of its doom.

                When the proud inventor stopped on Main Street, the
                most prominent merchants came out to meet him. There,
                surrounded by the wondering population, he explained
                the principles of his invention, its lightness of draught,
                its adaptation to the farm and to the city. Many of the
                best men of Sharptown, carried away by his eloquence,
                became admirers of the singular vehicle. Before the
                spectators had asked half the questions which they wished
                to propound, he drove to the Cass House, thinking it
                advisible to leave their curiosity but partly appeased.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hotel which had been appointed as the place of
                meeting, was the most pretentious in the town. The major
                was conducted to a room where he found the president
                of the Madgeburg wagon works. Br Boutwell was a very
                good-looking man with a business-like air, which was
                sustained by his manner, words and clothes. Ratke would
                have liked him better had he shown more of the agent's
                flattery and less of the buyer's independence. Still, he
                was equally independent in the negotiation, and he was
                willing to take the manufacturer's money, even though it
                was brusquely tendered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm glad you've come," said Br. Boutwell. "My
                nephew got hold of an Indianapolis 'Standard' and read
                the account of your wagon. We may not make a deal,
                probably sha'n't, but I'm willing to look at it. Where is
                it?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Out by the barn," answered the major. "You can
                see it from that window."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wish there wasn't such a crowd around it," remarked
                Mr. Boutwell. "We can't do anything looking at it now.
                We shall have to wait till they go away."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was anxious to finish the negotiation at once," said
                the major. "I must raise some money, and unless I
                sell the wagon, I must dispose of a piece of land. That
                is why I am anxious to come to a conclusion immediately."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, we can't make a deal to-day," said Mr. Boutwell.
                "Not under two weeks anyway. I must go to the company
                and report. If I think it is worth while, we'll take
                the wagon down to Madgeburg to look at it. Then if we
                all think it's an improvement, we'll give you a fair price
                for it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then," said the major sadly, "I must sell the farm.
                My business is such that I cannot wait."
            </p>
            <p>
                The Barton hundred and sixty was a fertile piece of
                land and had excellent buildings. A grasping farmer was
                ready to buy it for his son who was soon to be married, but
                knowing Ratke's circumstances, he would offer but thirty
                dollars an acre, little more than half its value. The
                cashier of the Second National Bank handed out a number
                of bills, which Ratke put into a bag. The bag was
                light, but the heart of the major was heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The afternoon was well spent when Ratke returned to
                the Cass House. The New Jerusalem, waxing old as an
                object of wonder, was nearly deserted by the crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
                As their acquaintance was prolonged, Mr. Boutwell became
                more talkative, or rather more agreeable, for he had
                been at first not unwilling to talk.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you like philosophy?" inquired the major.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very well," answered Mr. Boutwell. "I used to have
                a special liking for it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What author is your favorite?" asked Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I like Comstock," said Mr. Boutwell. "I think
                he's about as good as any of them."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Comstock," said the major in disgust, "he is the
                author of an elementary physics."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There are different tastes about authorities," observed
                Mr. Boutwell. "Some may not like Comstock. I think
                he does pretty well."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you like Hobbes?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "First-rate," ventured Mr. Boutwell, thinking that he
                now heard the name of the major's favorite, "I like him
                very much."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I do not. His theories are the most selfish ever put
                forth by a philosopher. What do you think of his work,
                the Leviathan?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "If I remember rightly," said Boutwell, "it has a fine
                description of the whale."
            </p>
            <p>
                The major concluded that Mr. Boutwell had given his
                entire energies to business. "I hope you are not a
                disciple of Hobbes," he remarked. "If you are, you will
                beat me down as much as you can on the price of my
                wagon. In that case, I can expect an offer from you of
                not more than five hundred."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no," said Boutwell, "not by any means. What I
                meant was that he could write pretty well. Now, am I
                right? Isn't his work in good style?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "A good style of its class," answered Ratke. "He
                attempts no excellence except in ratiocination."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's a good while since I've looked up these matters,"
                said Mr. Boutwell, "and as for rationation, that's away
                beyond my depth. I can over see the making on wagons
                and find sales for them, but I'm a poor hand to ratiocinate.
                It's six o'clock. We'll take some supper now.
                I'll have it brought up here, and then we can talk by ourselves."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke did not decline the manufacturer's invitation.
                They ate slowly, and lingered about the table after their
                appetites were satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come up to my place," said the major. "We can
                have a good chance there. We can test it in every way
                you wish."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know but I'll have to," acquiesced Mr. Boutwell.
                "They're not as thick as they were down there.
                New ones seem to be coming up all the time, though. I'll
                write a letter to Madgeburg before I go."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke waited for the president of the wagon works to
                write his letter. He had not purchased one of the
                articles for which Mrs. Grippin had sent. The sun was
                down when he had performed his many errands. At
                twilight he and Mr. Boutwell descended to the wagon, to
                which the hostler had hitched his team.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You will admin," said the major, "that the invention
                is original."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," responded Mr. Boutwell, "nobody will dispute
                that. But what is the matter with the boxes?"
            </p>
            <p>
                On the front box had been chalked a death's-head, A
                mule and various other designs. On the rear one had
                been pasted some enormous show-posters and some small
                bills.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The man that done that ought to be prosecuted,"
                remarked the manufacturer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no," said the major, apparently not in the least
                out of humor. "It was quite likely, done by boys. They
                meant no harm and did little. The posters can be washed
                off, and as for the chalk marks, they will not show when
                they are covered with paint."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am afraid," said Mr. Boutwell, when they had started
                on the angling road leading from Main Street to Break o'Day,
                "that the wagon will bother about hauling poles."
            </p>
            <p>
                "There is not the least trouble about that," assured the
                inventor. "You can take out all the end boards and put
                the poles, the forward parts in the forward box, the rear
                parts in the rear box. Of course, there is a small portion
                of the weight which has no support underneath, but not
                enough to cause a dangerous transverse strain. The
                intensity of stress on the wagon, too, is inconsiderable. It
                is, in terms of acceleration, force divided by area, M L divided
                by L T square. Land T, you observe, in this case are
                very large in proportion to M. And the poles can be so
                conveniently loaded. You have to raise them no higher
                than you do when you are carrying them. How many
                ruptures and strains would be saved if men could load
                wheat into this wagon. After we get home, we will haul
                poles until you are satisfied."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The high posts are one objection," said Mr. Boutwell.
                "They look bad, and I can't think of anything they're
                good for."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can think of several uses which they have," said
                Ratke. "They make good standards for a hay-rack.
                This morning Dr. Rorus observed that this would be the
                best wagon in the world for public occasions, such as the
                Fourth of July. Flags and banners could be attached to
                the posts, and they could be seen for a great distance."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How about its draught?" asked Mr. Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That is its strong point," said Ratke. "The propelling
                force has a good chance to act. Its point of application
                is low. And it lessens the pressure on the wheels.
                The six-foot wheel and the two-inch pivot, too, form
                another great advantage, as they materially lessen the
                friction. Every time a wheel revolves, one fourth the
                weight of the load scrapes over the circumference of its
                axel or pivot. In the New Jerusalem the wheel is six feet
                in diameter, and the pivot two inches. In the common
                wagon the wheel is, say five feet, and the axle three inches.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the New Jerusalem the load is propelled seventy-two
                inches while the movement at the point of friction is
                two inches. In the common wagon the load is propelled
                sixty-inches, while the movement at the point of friction is
                three inches. In the New Jerusalem the ratio of frictional
                movement to the distance of transportation is thirty-six.
                In the common wagon it is twenty."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wouldn't it be a good plan to have a spindle turn on
                rollers ?" asked Mr. Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have thought of that," said the major. "That
                changes the loss of power at the spindle or pivot from
                sliding to rolling friction. But these small wheels must
                turn on spindles or pivots and engender the sliding friction
                they are calculated to prevent. Thus we exchange
                the sliding friction for both sliding and rolling friction."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What will you take for that nigh horse?" asked Mr.
                Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Four thousand dollars," replied the major.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He must be a good one," commented Mr. Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fair," said Ratke, in a way which intimated that he
                was stating Taylor's merits with moderation.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have been talking some of getting me a horse," said
                Mr. Boutwell, "but that is more than I want to invest.
                Can't you start him up? I'd like to see him move off a
                little faster."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Charge," said the major in a quiet tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wagon started with such suddenness that the sleek
                manufacturer was jerked violently backward. His beaver
                fell and was run over by the hind wheel. The president
                of the wagon works clutched the side of the box and
                remonstrated with Ratke on his fast driving. "Oh, I
                wouldn't drive too fast. Major! It's a warm night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "My team is good for it," responded Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It ain't safe," said Mr. Boutwell, after a heavy jolt had
                thrown him to the opposite side of the box. "Something
                might break. Hold on. Major, I've lost my hat!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Halt," commanded the major. Instantly the team
                topped, and Mr. Boutwell was pitched headlong against
                the dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's useless fast driving," he said. "It's unreasonable
                in hot weather." His face was sad as he returned
                with his once magnificent hat which, with its crown crushed
                in, was quite ruined.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major, stopping at Birch & Bigney's store, purchased
                a hat for Mr. Boutwell, not, indeed, one so impressive
                as the demolished beaver had been, but the best
                which Break o' Day afforded. He was not sorry for the
                misfortune of his companion, who, intent on the transaction
                of their business, had taken no pains to make himself
                agreeable. He wished that the company had sent another
                man, whose criticism was less free.

            <p>
                "I don't like that squeaking," said Mr. Boutwell. "It
                looks to me as if there wasn't much of a chance to
                grease the wheels. Your machinist must be a poor workman."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can soon fix the wheels so we can grease them,"
                said the major. "Now, as to the pivot, you think that it is
                very rough. You notice that the pitch of the squeak is
                high, on the key of C, I think. There must be, then, one
                thousand and fifty-six vibrations per second. "The motion
                at the pivot, as I said, is slight. In order to have one
                thousand and fifty-six vibrations of sound result from a
                slight motion the protuberances must be very small.
                What do you think you can pay me for my wagon?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't say now," answered Mr. Boutwell. "I don't
                know as we can buy it at all. If we take it, we'll give you
                a good price. But before we negotiate, we would want
                you to agree not to go to any other company till you've
                got through with us. If I think it worth while, I'll have
                you drive out to Madgeburg."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can ride with me," said Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said Mr. Boutwell, "you go too fast and stop
                too quick for me. I must get back to attend to business.
                I'll take the cars."
            </p>
            <p>
                "When you understand one principle you will be all
                right to ride with me," said Ratke. 'Action is equal to
                reaction, and in a contrary direction.' What you must
                guard against is reaction. It was reaction which pitched
                you against the dashboard. This law has application
                elsewhere than in the physical world. A man is persecuted
                by society. In time it is discovered that he has been a
                martyr, and be is lauded as much as he has been abused.
            </p>
            <p>
                My New Jerusalem is now rediculed. In a few years its
                praises will be in every man's mouth. 'Action is equal
                to reaction and in a contrary direction.'"
            </p>
            <p>
                Can you always make your horses stop as quick as
                you did back yonder?" asked Mr. Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major showed his ability to govern his team by
                again giving the order to stop. The president of the wagon
                works placed his hands on Ratke's shoulders and pulled
                him backward. Then he quickly put his knee astride his
                body and grasped his arms.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't hardly believe I'll go home with you," said
                Mr. Boutwell with a grin. "I've got to get back to Madgeburg
                to oversee the wagon works. Now I'd like a little
                money to pay my fare with."
            </p>
            <p>
                They were in the center of the swamp, the lights in the
                farm-houses had gone out, and interference was not likely
                to come. Ratke was not terrified by the unlooked-for assault.
                He did not struggle. Calmly and reproachfully
                he looked up in the face of the robber who had so basely
                betrayed his confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want you to fork over that money," said Mr. Boutwell,
                "and don't be a great while about it. I'm not going
                to be fooled with."
            </p>
            <p>
                Still the major did not answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are you going to give me that money?" demanded
                Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then I'll make it uncomfortable for you!" exclaimed
                Boutwell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can have my life," said the major, "and you will
                have to take it if you get my money."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We won't ratiocinate now," said Mr. Boutwell.
                "You're great on sliding friction and rolling friction.
                Now slide or roll out that money, or there'll be a friction
                you don't like!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Boutwell's hand reached quickly towards a side pocket,
                but it was grasped by Ratke, when, with his left, he struck
                the old man a heavy blow under the eye. With the blood
                trickling down his cheek Ratke strove to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now," said Boutwell, "you stop kicking around and
                do as I tell you or I'll shoot you through the heart! Be
                in a hurry, too. We ain't talking wagon now. Come
                now, no Hobbes nor transverse strain."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Charge!" shouted the major. At that magic word
                the wheels of the New Jerusalem raised clear from the
                ground, and the three squeaks blended in one, which was
                shrill, continuous and ear-splitting. Mr. Boutwell was
                pitched against the rear end-board, but he regained his
                equilibrium and again struck Ratke. He was in a fair
                way to administer a terrible punishment to the philosopher
                when a great jolt threw him off his balance; and before
                he recovered himself, the old man, whose strength he had
                under-estimated, rolled him and began to rain blows upon
                his face. Ratke's fighting blood was up, and he plied
                his fists with such vigor that Mr. Boutwell soon cried,
                "Hold up! Hold up! I'll quit. I've got enough."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am sorry," said the major, "that I have been obliged
                to strike a man who was down. I trust you will pardon
                me. And now you have seen a demonstration of the
                theorem which I stated. 'Action is equal to reaction and
                in a contrary direction.' Halt."
            </p>
            <p>
                The team stopped at the edge of the tamaracks. The
                New Jerusalem was now a veritable chariot, for it had
                been uncoupled by the jolt which had demoralized Boutwell,
                and the hind wheels were far back on the causeway.
                A thick cloud of dust hovered over the road along which
                they had sped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will send one of my men down after it to-morrow,"
                said Ratke. "We will go on without it now. You can
                get up, Mr. Boutwell. Allow me to search your pockets."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke, after taking two revolvers from the pockets of
                his new acquaintance, drove on in silence. At the large
                gate by the house he stopped and called, "Mark, Mark,
                come and take care of the team."

                CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
                <small>ONE HOUR OF BLISS.</small>
            </h2>
            <p>
                By Mrs. Boyle's clock it lacked twenty-two minutes of
                midnight. It was the hour for sleep and repose, yet it
                was an hour of activity. The hornets were buzzing in
                their hidden nests, the millers were flitting about the
                lamp. The two human occupants of the house were excited.
                One had been brutally attacked; and the other had
                come to her assistance too late, or, perhaps,
                providentially late.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You say he is not my son," said Mrs. Boyle. "You
                talk as if you knew, John."
            </p>
            <p>
                He noticed with pleasure that she called him John.
                "So I do know," he replied. "A dull man ought to be
                able to tell that. When I am convinced that the loftiest
                virtue begets the grossest vice, I will believe that you are
                his mother."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," she said, "he is not my son. None of the neighbors
                know it, and he don't know it. I'm sure you won't
                tell anything I don't want you to."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said John earnestly, "I never will."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then, if you're not sleepy," said Mrs. Boyle, "I will
                tell you the whole story. When Mr. Boyle was alive, we
                stayed several years in Chicago. We lived just a little
                ways from Alfred's folks. I guess I won't tell even you
                his real name. His father and mother were bad characters.
                They both drank and stole. They would quarrel
                and sometimes fight. Once in a while he pounded her
                terribly. Little Alfred would scream as loud as he could.
                He wasn't big enough to talk much. Then, if Mr. Boyle
                was at home, he would go over to see about it. The
                last time he went Alfred's father and mother both told
                him to go home and never come there again. They
                could manage their own affairs. Finally he pounded her
                so that he was arrested and sent to jail. It wasn't long
                after that she stole some valuable jewelry out of a store.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was in court when they sentenced her. She might
                I have got off easier but she was sullen, just like Alfred,
                and she prejudiced them against her. She was sent to.
                the penitentiary for a year. It was hard to see that little
                fellow hanging to her hand, and to think what a training he
                would get. I told her if she would give him to me, I
                would take him. She seemed to be glad to get him off
                her hands, and she said she hadn't any objections."
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Boyle gave John an account of her and her protégé
                since Mr. Boyle's death, of their removal to Michigan, of
                Alf's growing depravity, which he manifested even in his
                early childhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He is naturally bad," said John. "You might as well
                try to turn a bramble to a peach tree as to attempt to
                make a respectable man of him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know he has got into some awful trouble," said
                Mrs. Boyle. "I don't expect him back very soon. But
                if he comes, you must stay above, no matter how he
                acts."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You want me to be less than a man," replied John.
                "You think I would stay up there and let him strike you.
                If he attempts any such thing again, I will come sooner
                than I did before."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then he certainly will kill you," said Mrs. Boyle.
                "You don't know him. He has a passion for killing
                things. Whenever he can, he takes the life of a chipmunk,
                or a toad, or a fly, or anything, no matter what
                it is."
            </p>
            <p>
                John remembered the millers, the bat and the squirrel;
                and he knew that Mrs. Boyle's estimate of the ruffian's
                character was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, do as I tell you, John," she continued. "You
                seem almost like my own boy. You won't get mad if I
                call you John, will you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said John, "I wish I were your son."
            </p>
            <p>
                He thought long of her words. Until then, motherless,
                not quite friendless, he had yearned for that sympathy
                which, coming only from the maternal heart, cures wounds
                of the spirit and body and makes suffering almost desirable,
                that the joy of healing may be experienced. Instinct
                had told him that he needed it. Other boys had been
                petted and caressed while he had been kicked and cursed.
                Now, when boyhood was passed, he had found a foster-mother
                who was kinder than his natural parent, whose
                touch was balm for bodily pain, whose presence banished
                despondency, whose words were gentle in consolation and
                in reproof. He would have laid down his life for her and
                rejoiced in the sacrifice. Could he have been her son,
                even if disgrace had still clung to him, how much of misery
                would he have escaped.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun was again peeping over the tall trees when
                two men walked across the clearing and inquired for
                Alfred Boyle. After satisfying themselves by inquiries
                that he was not in the house, and informing Mrs. Boyle
                that he was wanted for robbery at Birch & Bigney'S
                store, they passed on.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can come down, John," said Mrs. Boyle, stopping
                under the entrance to the loft. "Alfred won't be back in
                a good while."
            </p>
            <p>
                John's leg made rapid progress toward recovery. With
                Mrs. Boyle's permission, for he was generally scrupulous
                in yielding to her wishes, he walked about the small clearing
                on his crutches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The excitement over his adventure had materially subsided,
                or had given place tot hat over the recent robbery.
                It was whispered here and there that possibly the real
                thief had not accused, and it was universally
                admitted that the mob had acted with more haste than justice.
                Still, John did not care to have his whereabouts known.
                Such a knowledge would lead to his arrest, when he would
                be asked to furnish some explanations which he could not
                satisfactorily give. And yet, menaced by those consequences,
                he took risks. Without the knowledge of Mrs.
                Boyle he wandered to the narrow strip of improved land
                which lay between the woods and the swamp. He must
                get where he could see beyond the small pen in which he
                was imprisoned by the forest, and he must not show contempt
                of her orders. Each day he sat for an hour at the
                foot of a large tree, scanning the continuous strip of
                timber. The long field was the one which with its great
                brittle lumps of sand he had passed a short time previous
                to his accidental meeting with the Wallaces. The high
                oaks on the opposite side hid the waters of Coon Lake
                and the village of Break o'Day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the high belt of wood was one for a sight of
                whom he would have ventured much. That misgiving
                which he had felt at their parting, that impulse which in
                the face of resistance had urged him to bid a second adieu
                were not vain follies, but the warnings of, and, had he
                heeded them, the preparation for an occurrence the end of
                which he could not foretell. He speculated as to the
                probable location of Ratke's house. He believed that
                with the aid of his mathematics he could determine it with
                a fair degree of accuracy. After some deliberation he
                fixed upon a depression in the upper edge of the woods,
                as the place which had been hollowed out by nature that
                his gaze might more nearly approach the Gothic house
                with its shroud of evergreens and its greater attraction
                within. His hand impulsively went to his lips and threw
                a greeting toward the imaginary gateway. To verify his
                mathematical observations he obtained Mrs. Boyle's
                compass. What was the reaction when he discovered that he
                had mistaken north for northwest and that he had thrown
                his kiss in the direction of Julia Wallace! Rectifying his
                mistake, he decided that the dry top of a lofty tamarack
                which stood where the skirt of the hard-wood timber ended
                was between him and Manie. His breast heaved, but it
                soon harbored that discontent which had been engendered
                by his early training. Chances for which some vainly
                long are given, to others who have for them not the
                slightest appreciation. The dry old tree-top cared not
                for youth and beauty. Stripped of its foliage to mitigate
                the force of the wind and groaning whenever an unusual
                gust strained its rheumatic seams, it might look down on
                Ratke's, might see a graceful form and composed, dignified
                face emerging from the evergreens, yet it ignored its
                privileges, while they were yearned for by another.
            </p>
            <p>
                One night John announced to Mrs. Boyle his intention
                to take his departure from her house.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hate to have you go," she said, "you step as if your
                ankle was nearly well, but you know it is weak yet. You
                are welcome to stay, and I'd like to have you. It will be
                lonesome when you are gone. Aren't you afraid they'll
                try to arrest you?
            </p>
            <p>
                "I shall go to Barton Junction," said John, "and I have
                no acquaintances there. So many crimes have been committed
                in this section lately that strangers will not be on
                the lookout to apprehend me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are not going to-night?" asked Mrs. Boyle, as
                John took his hat.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not to the Junction," said John, as he arose. "But I
                may not be back until late."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, John," said Mrs. Boyle, laying her hand on his
                arm, "be careful. Don't expose yourself too much.
                Don't go to Break o' Day, or any place where there are
                drunken men. You don't know what they would do."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will do as you say," answered John, as he stepped
                outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                He crossed the clearing, on the poorly-cultivated surface
                of which fire-weeds had grown rank and thick. As
                emitted an acrid odor which suggested the appropriateness
                of their name. Wrengell took the road which he
                had lost in his first approach to the lonely house in the
                clearing. The plentiful light streaming from the heavens
                showed the nightly magnificence of the wood. A furlong
                from the edge the underbrush was scant, so that the
                large trunks were visible for rods. Slender plats of fresh
                green grass were scattered at intervals, their loveliness
                more apparent because contrasted with the brown spread
                of dry leaves. Their verdancy had been preserved in the
                cool shade furnished by the great white oaks, whose
                strong arms were outstretched to the shelter them from the
                heat of midday.
            </p>
            <p>
                McDuff's heavy gate with the stone balance swung open
                as easily as it had done two weeks before. Not wishing to
                follow the road, John crossed it and clambered over the
                opposite fence. He deemed it advisable to proceed along
                the edge of the swamp, where, should he be observed, he
                could find a refuge at once. A bright fire, evidently from
                a high brush heap, was burning at the border of the woods
                beyond the wide stretch of fields. That he was nearing
                familiar territory he was apprised by a sound which he had
                once detested, but which was now far from unwelcome,
                the yelping of Takum's dogs. He crossed a second road
                and was shortly in the major's field, for the leveling of
                which the hands had worked so long in the spring.
            </p>
            <p>
                He stood a minute by the front gate. The loud talking
                of the men had ceased in the club-house. It was past
                the hour when the major's family was in the habit of retiring,
                yet a light was burning in the parlor. John stole
                to a window and looked inside. Not a person was in
                sight. This was inexplicable to him, as it was Ratke's
                custom to put out the lights before going to bed. He was
                astonished when, taking a closer view, he saw Archer
                yawning over a thick octavo volume, the pages of which
                he occasionally turned. His fellow hired man had not
                been famed for his love of books, and he wondered that
                he should suddenly become so devoted a student as to
                read until midnight. He could account for his presence
                there at that hour, only on the supposition that one of the
                household was sick and that he was serving as watcher.
                While he was endeavoring to solve the riddle, Mrs.
                Grippin appeared, blew out the light, gave some injunctions
                which he could not distinguish, and retired. Making
                a reconnoissance of the house, John discovered that
                lights were burning in two of the back bedrooms, which
                were separated by a distance of a few feet. Curtains were
                before the windows, and on one of them was impressed
                the shadow of a human form. For some minutes he
                watched it, undecided whether it were made by Nora or
                by Manie. At last the figure quickly jerked its head,
                disappeared for an instant and returned. It did not belong
                to Manie, it was that of her impulsive cousin.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a throbbing heart he went cautiously to another
                window. Drawing a long breath, he raised his finger
                hesitatingly. It trembled an instant in the air and fell
                several times faintly on the pane. There was a rustling
                of paper within, a sound as of some one closing a book
            </p>
            <p>
                and moving about in a chair. He was tempted to draw
                back from his adventure. Admitting that he had rightly
                guessed the location Manie's room, how was he assured
                that she would welcome a communication at midnight, or
                that she might not be affrighted and raise an alarm. She
                had quitted the chair. She was about to take some action,
                either to respond to his signal, or to tell the household
                that some one was prowling near the room. If he would
                prevent her from raising an outcry, he must speak without
                delay. He must see her. He must say the farewell
                which he had once repressed. He placed his lips almost
                to the glass and whispered, "Manie. Manie. Miss
                Ratke," he corrected, alarmed at his familiarity. The
                curtains parted, and the face of Manie appeared, not
                affrighted, but lacking its usual serenity. She started as
                she saw a man close enough to touch her had he broken
                that barrier of glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do not be alarmed," said John. "It is I, John, John
                Wrengell."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is it you?" asked Manie. John thought that there
                was something of joy in her manner. "We were afraid
                you were dead," she continued. "We had not heard
                from you in so long."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can you not get on your bonnet and come out?" said
                John. "I am afraid we shall be overheard."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come to-morrow," said Manie, "and we will all be
                glad to see you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I cannot," responded John sadly. "I am afraid I
                never can come again. I am going away to-morrow
                morning, and I would like to talk with you a few minutes."
            </p>
            <p>
                His hope of having his request granted was so slight
                that he was surprised when she put on a straw hat and
                began to raise the window. He assisted her to the ground,
                and they stood together outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let us go to the orchard," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was there that she had accepted the first offer of his
                company. He wished, but he doubted, that his words
                would be as well received as they were on that Sabbath
                morning when the blossoms were fluttering from the
                agitated boughs. At the foot of a harvest tree Manie
                stooped to pick up an apple. She was not hungry, and
                she had no definite purpose in so doing; but John, supposing
                that she wished to satisfy her appetite, sprang up the
                tree in search of its best products. Like a red squirrel
                he raced from limb to limb and soon descended, bringing
                a pocketful of mellow apples, which he insisted that she
                should take.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that he was in her presence, he was at a loss what
                to do or what to say. He could not bear to go away
                without taking her hand and bidding her an informal
                farewell which, if they were destined to meet no more, would
                ever be a delightful memory. He dreaded to follow his
                inclinations, lest he should be repulsed and their parting
                be an event which would bring the most miserable
                recollections. He began to feel that their meeting was a
                disappointment, that in social position and in mutual
                regard they were and must of necessity be far apart.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I must go in," said Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, not yet! Please do not go yet!" John
                remonstrated. "We have just begun to talk.''
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have stayed a great while now," said Manie. "If
                people knew it, what would they say of my climbing from
                a window to meet you at night?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "They will not know it," said John, "and there is no
                hurt in it, I am sure. I own it does not reflect credit on
                you to be seen with me. I am poor and disgraced. I do
                not wish to drag you down to my level. To-morrow
                morning I go away, and I shall not come back. Keep
                from me in the future, but to-night bid me good-bye as
                you would an equal."
            </p>
            <p>
                "And where will you go?" asked Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Of that I am uncertain," said John. "I mean to
                escape from my evil destiny. It has followed me like a
                hound all my life. But I will struggle with it to the end.
                If I am overcome, it will be when I have strength to fight
                no longer. I mean yet to make a man whom the world will
                and must respect. I will take no rest, I will work in
                season and out of season; and if I fail, it will not be my
                fault."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I believe you will succeed," said Manie. "You
                certainly deserve to."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you think so?" said John, excited so much that
                his articulation was indistinct. "By God's help I will
                succeed! Manie, Miss Ratke, I will go and try. If I
                fail, I will stay away as long as I live. But if I succeed,
                if the world by its recognition acknowledges the wrong it
                has done me, may I come back, come back with hope in
                my heart, and ask you to be my wife?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can consent to no such proposal," said Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I do not blame you," said John dejectedly. "I make
                an unreasonable request."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You wrong me," said Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," assented John, "I was foolish to speak as I did.
                You have a right to resent such an offer from one in my
                position."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I care nothing for your position," said Manie, "But
                your offer implies that I am selfish. It accuses me of
                wishing to share your fortune, but escape your misfortune.
                If I would have you at all, I would have you whether you
                were rich or poor, successful or unsuccessful, esteemed
                or despised."
            </p>
            <p>
                Again John felt the buoyancy of hope. She was near
                him, she, who, when he was menaced by danger and
                tortured with pain, had with hardly an interruption occupied
                his thoughts for a fortnight. His arm stole about
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do not drive me away just yet," he pleaded. "Repulse
                me if you will, but after I have done speaking.
                Manie, I must call you that name once, I did wrong you.
                But now I ask you, shall we not go together in joy and
                in sorrow, in prosperity and in adversity, in riches and
                in poverty, in fame and in disgrace, as long as we live?
                It is a great sacrifice which I ask of you. Do not answer
                me yet. Let me be in suspense. Let me think for
                a moment that I have won you, that we need not again
                be separated."
            </p>
            <p>
                She did not reply, and his grasp involuntarily tightened.
                There was inspiration to John in every sight
                and sound, in every message communicated by the senses.
                The wind gently touched his brow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every orb in the sky was sending down its quota
                of light. The house showed its roof and eaves above
                the trees, as if it had been dropped and had sunk in its
                soft cushion of green. The branches of the apple tree,
                swaying slightly, cast at their feet silver bars and meshes
                of bright net-work. The steady signing of the cricket,
                blending with the sharp jerking chirrup of the katydid,
                closed his eyes and plunged him into a reverie, which
                was brief, delightful, and ever after unforgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am ready for your answer," said John. "Sentence
                me as you will."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," said Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her reply destroyed the last vestige of his composure.
                He threw his other arm frantically about her and kissed
                her again and again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Stop, stop!" said Manie. "One arm in that posture
                is enough. I shall have to go in now."
            </p>
            <p>
                They said nothing as they walked to the house. John
                opened the window and lifted her carefully through.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Give me a good-night kiss," he said. "I do not like
                to take leave of you as formally as I did the last time I
                was in the house."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope you are satisfied now," she said, after his
                demand had been granted.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was about to take another salute without permission,
                when Manie, anticipating his design, quickly
                withdrew her head and closed the window.

            </h2>
            <p>
                "HELLOA!" exclaimed Daggett, as he approached the
                gate, "where's the hind wheels?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "The road was rough, and the wagon uncoupled," said
                the major. "They are on the causeway, but you need
                not mind them till morning. Perhaps you had better
                have Will take care of the team. I shall want you to do
                an errand for me in the course of an hour."
            </p>
            <p>
                Daggett case some curious looks at Mr. Boutwell as he
                opened the gate and led the team through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Whatever is the matter with you, James Ratke?"
                ejaculated Mrs. Grippin, when her brother and his
                unwilling vistor stood before her. "You've been fighting.
                That's just the way you used to look when you was a
                boy and got into rows. I'd be ashamed, an old man like
                you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mr. Boutwell, my sister," said the major, ignoring
                Mrs. Grippin's tirade. "Come this way, Mr. Boutwell,
                and we will wash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratke treated the spurious wagon manufacturer with
                the utmost deference. He kept an eye on his movements,
                however, and Mr. Boutwell understood that though he
                might expect the treatment of a king, it would be that of
                a captive king. He got him water wash and insisted
                that his would be dressed before his own. Mr. Boutwell,
                whose experience with the philosopher had taught
                him better than to refuse his courtesies, was the picture
                of humiliation, as Ratke clumsily adjusted plasters over
                his split upper lip and a contusion on his cheek. Mrs.
                Grippin, unable to longer absent herself, entered the
                kitchen, where she was followed by the girls, who had
                arisen to ascertain what had befallen their uncle. The
                major in his most polite manner introduced Mr. Boutwell
                to the young ladies.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So you've been fighting, Uncle James," said Nora.
                "Who did you" have a fight with?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I cannot explain it to you now, little girl," said the
                major.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You will, won't you, Mr. Boutwell?" said Nora.
                "Oh, you got into it, too, did you? You and Uncle
                James must have been together against a lot of 'em.
                Uncle James always sticks by his friends. Didn't he
                stick by you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Close enough," answered Mr. Boutwell with a grin.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are badly hurt. Uncle James," said Manie.
                "Your eye is swollen, almost shut, and the cut under it
                does not stop bleeding yet."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is nothing," said Ratke, "a little scratch. It takes
                a worse wound than that to affect me."
            </p>
            <p>
                Manie put a plaster over the bruised part. One of the
                major's eyes looked sleepy, and Mr. Boutwell's face was
                spotted with contusions and plasters.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This way now, Mr. Boutwell," said the major, leading
                the way to the parlor, "make yourself comfortable while
                I do some writing."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Manie," he called, when he had finished a short note,
                "tell Mark to take this to Jim Turner. And now, Mr.
                Boutwell," he said, "we will go."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wonder where in the world they've gone to at this
                time of the night," said Mrs. Grippin, as the sound of
                their footsteps was dying away. "Some notion James
                has got, I suppose."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who do you think they had a fight with?" asked Nora.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you suppose I know any more than you do?"
                sharply returned Mrs. Grippin. "James ought to have
                more care for his reputation than to get into such a
                scrape. And the president of a big wagon company surely
                could find better business than fighting."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Maybe they stopped to Break o'Day, and somebody
                pitched into 'em," suggested Nora.
            </p>
            <p>
                "More likely somebody made fun of James' wagon,
                and he got mad," said Mrs. Grippin. "That'll touch
                him up the quickest of anything."
            </p>
            <p>
                The major returned late, and Mr. Boutwell was not
                with him. He refused to give any information concerning
                his visitor, except that he had gone and would not
                again come back. The next morning, waxing more
                communicative, he yielded to Mrs. Grippin's influence, and
                admitted that Mr. Boutwell had attempted to rob him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's the way your speculation turned out," commented
                Mrs. Grippin. "You might know he didn't
                mean it when he said he was coming to buy your wagon.
                He ain't such a fool as I thought he was."
            </p>
            <p>
                "He is no fool," said Ratke. "He wished to obtain
                my money. He estimated properly the force at his disposal,
                but fell into the common error of miscalculating
                the amount of resistance. I must have Mark hitch up
                Taylor. I shall have to go to Jackson to-day."
            </p>
            <p>
                Why, to-day, is the day Durgenson is coming," said
                Mrs. Grippin.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He wrote me that he cannot be here until to-morrow,
                said Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now," cautioned the housekeeper, "don't you take
                that money with you, James. It's the safest here."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I had rather risk it with me," said the major. I am
                able to defend it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Grippin. "Such a
                careless man! You'll fall in with a sleek fellow that
                wants to buy your wagon, or some other knave; and the
                first thing you know, it will be gone. Now, James," she said
                with more moderation, "where did you get that money?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Maria," answered the major, "I got it from the Barton
                hundred and sixty. I have sold it."
            </p>
            <p>
                Without a word Mrs. Grippin turned and went to the
                parlor. Their last foot of land had been sold. She knew
                not when the order would come to leave the homestead
                and go into the street. They might find a home, but
                what kind of home? Nora would go to her aristocratic
                relatives. Manie might die or get married. She pictured
                mentally the two who formed the relic of the family,
                Ratke grubbing by the day, herself doing washing for
                Sparks and Mrs. Green. She was not ashamed to work;
                but she was ashamed to know and to have the world
                know that their property had been recklessly parted with,
                to slave for others in their old age, and finally to be
                dependent on local charity or go to the poor-house.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major came home at dusk. "Well, Maria," he
                said, "I have escaped without meeting any bad fortune."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You want to look out for to-night," cautioned his sister.
                "Everybody knows that money is here. You must
                watch it to-night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am too tired to sit up," Ratke objected. "I was up
                all last night. It will be all right under my head."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, it won't," said Mrs. Grippin. "You've got to get
                some one to watch it, then."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hardly know whom to get," said the major. "All
                the men up west have been to Oakville, looking after the
                fire. Perhaps Philetus would come."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Phleet," cried Mrs. Grippin wrathfully, "Phleet
                Takum! Haven't you got any more judgment than that?
                You know he takes whatever he can lay his hands on!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I suppose I might hire Abner Wallace," suggested
                Ratke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I declare!" ejaculated Mrs. Grippin, after a moment
                of speechlessness. "Pick out a thief to watch money!
                James, you are a bright one! Get one of your men."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hate to ask them to do such things when they work
                hard," said the major. "Mark is always willing to do
                odd chores, but he did not go to bed till late last night.
                I will see what I can do with them."
            </p>
            <p>
                As the major went up the club-house steps, there was a
                scrambling among the inmates. He opened the door too
                late to see what had occasioned the confusion. The table
                was covered with a newspaper, which was raised at one
                corner enough to show several cards. But he did not
                notice the evidence of immorality.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Will," he said, "Maria will give me no peace until I
                get a man to stay in the house to-night. She thinks we
                are liable to be robbed. I have not the slightest fear of
                such a danger, but to keep peace in the family I must do
                as she wishes. Can you come?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I've been to work awful hard to-day," said Archer.
                "That's tough ploughing, you know. It's all I can do to
                keep the plough in the ground. I could get along with it,
                but I'm all drilled out."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know it is hard work," said Ratke, "But Mark
                was up last night, and I cannot ask him to go."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll go, Major," said Daggett,
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said the major, "I will not let you. You have
                lost sleep enough."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wouldn't care so much about it," said Archer, "if it
                wasn't for to-morrow. But this working as tight as you
                can jump and then being up all night, and then keeping
                right on the next day, it's too much."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, as to that," said Ratke, "you can sleep twenty-
                four hours, commencing at six o'clock, if you wish."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Seeing it's an emergency, I'll go," said Archer. "Of
                course, I'm willing to make some sacrifice, Major,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "You need not come until ten o'clock unless you wish,"
                said the major, opening the door to depart, "We will sit
                up as late as that."
            </p>
            <p>
                "He wanted you," said Daggett, "and he didn't seem
                to want anybody else, I wonder why that was."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well," said Archer, "he knows what I am. I've
                worked for him a good while."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Say," said Daggett, "if you get into a snooze, and a
                horse-thief goes to jabbing you with a fish-pole, you want
                to holler."
            </p>
            <p>
                Archer, not relishing the reminiscences of his watch in
                the swamp, went at once to the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Grippin was in a passion over the major's choice
                of watchman. "Now, Will," she said, "I want you to
                have some gumption about you. Wake up once in your
                life,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," said Archer, "I'll tend right to it, Mrs. Grippin,
                The major knows he can trust me for that,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope he is right," said Mrs. Grippin, "He and the
                girls are in the parlor."
            </p>
            <p>
                The major explained his plan of guarding the money.
                There was no danger, he said, but seeing Archer was to
                watch, he should take every precaution against a robbery.
                He should extinguish the light, he should barricade every
                door leading to the room. Then with the money and a
                revolver he should get into a dark corner. The north-
                east was the best one.

                "This reminds me of an incident which happened in
                Wisconsin Territory," said Ratke, "when we were chasing
                Black Hawk. We had been marching all day, constantly
                expecting to come up with the Indians. At night
                we camped in the edge of a strip of woods, I was just
                thinking of what a fine sleep I should have when the
                sergeant told me I was on for picket duty. My watch
                commenced at one o'clock. They posted me at least seventy
                rods from the camp, a short distance from a creek. It
                was rather a dark night and as we looked for an assault,
                I did not fancy the position. Standing where the enemy
                can see you, but you cannot see him, is quite different
                from advancing toward a perceptible danger. I knew
                that if the Sacs and Foxes were prowling about, they had
                an excellent chance to get my scalp. Sounds as of something
                going cautiously over the leaves kept coming from
                some woods on the other side of the creek. Presently
                there was a disturbance in the water, a subdued splashing
                which I knew to be occasioned by the crossing of a man
                or of some animal. The grass, which was tall and thick,
                began to wave suspiciously, and to add to my uneasiness
                the waves were coming toward me. I was at a loss what
                to do. Staying there for a target with the certainty of
                being hit the first fire was not in the least agreeable.
                Abandoning the post and giving an unnecessary alarm
                was to be avoided if possible. I got under cover of
                a tree, held my rifle ready to use, and waited. I could see
                a distinct advancing motion of the grass. I own I was
                nervous as I fired. I was still more so, when the steady
                motion changed to a spasmodic struggling and some
                objects which I could not see retreated: I had now no
                doubt as to the proximity of the Indians, but I did not
                think it my duty to go to the spot where I had heard the
                struggling. I waited a few minutes and could plainly
                distinguish more splashing as if others were crossing the
                creek. In a few minutes I was certain that some figures
                were skulking along between me and the camp. The
                disturbance in the grass near the creek continued. The
                camp had been warned and I felt justifiable in abandoning
                my post. As I bore to the right, three or four shots
                from the direction of the skulkers made me give one
                mighty jump. I brought my rifle to my shoulder, fired
                and ran. When I got to camp, everybody was up ready
                for an attack. The first man I met was the orderly
                sergeant.
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Why, Ratke,' said the sergeant when I came up, 'we
                thought they'd killed you. Did you shoot at them or did
                they shoot at you?'
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Both,' I answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Well, that's queer,' said the sergeant. 'We heard
                only one shot'
            </p>
            <p>
                "'I should think it is queer,' I answered. 'I fired at
                them. Then they got between me and the camp and fired
                three or four shots at me and I fired back.'
            </p>
            <p>
                "'Now I don't see how that is,' said the sergeant.
                'We saw one of them moving off. We fired at him, and
                he fired back, and the ball just scraped Montcalm's side.'
            </p>
            <p>
                "'What!' I said, 'was it you who came out there?'
                I understood it then. They had heard the shot I fired
                and had crept out, when we mutually mistook each other
                for Indians, In the morning I found near my post the
                body of the largest raccoon I ever saw. New guards are
                always fearful of an attack from the enemy. They forget
                that the same prudence which they have will keep the foe
                from hazarding a rash assault."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can't you sing something for us, Mr. Archer?" asked
                Nora, beginning to yawn.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I guess not, Mrs. Warfle," answered Archer, in
                the manner which indifferent artists employ to induce more
                urging. "I guess I hadn't better."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, yes, now, Mr. Archer," pleaded Nora. "If you
                only knew how we like to hear you. Why, if I could sing
                like you can, I'd give almost anything."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's what a good many folks have said, but still I
                don't claim to be anything great," observed Archer modestly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How did you learn to sing so nice?" inquired Nora.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well," said Archer, "it's Nature does the most of it."
            </p>
            <p>
                At this juncture the vain major, whose greatest intolerance
                was for the weakness which he shared, left the
                room, unwilling to see his own folly in so exaggerated a
                form.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can sing so strong," said Nora. "I've heard
                Aunt Maria say she never knew any one with such a
                voice."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, Nora," said Mrs. Grippin, suddenly making her
                appearance, "you've got to quit such nonsense for I won't
                have it! You shan't be mixing my name in."
            </p>
            <p>
                Archer supposed that the housekeeper was displeased
                because she rightly suspected that he was making a deep
                impression on Nora. Loath to give up the exercise of his
                fascination, he exchanged sly glances with the young lady,
                to the great wrath of Mrs. Grippin, who determined to
                wait until the proper moment, and then, rising in her just
                indignation, to send Nora to bed. But as Nora caught
                the gleam of her eye, and Archer abandoned his winking
                and leering on finding that they were not returned, the
                Trebian ambush was never sprung. Mrs. Grippin finally
                returned to her room, saying, as she did so,
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, Nora, if I hear any more nonsense, you'll start
                to bed."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mr. Archer," said Nora, a few minutes after the
                departure of her stern relative, "did you ever read history
                much?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," said Archer, "I've read it a good deal."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who do you think was the greatest man that ever
                lived?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, now, I can't say positive," said Archer with a
                wise nod," but I kind o' think George Washington was,
                don't you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," said Nora, "I think Tammany Hall was. But
                they didn't treat him very well, though."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's a fact," said Archer, "they used him miserable."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who do you think was to blame?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, now, it's been a good while since I've read it
                and a fellow will forget, you know. What do you think?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think Queen Elizabeth was. Let's see. What was
                it he said when he got on board the steamer that was to
                take him to Cape Colony? Farewell, O England, thou
                land of my birth.'"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, that was it," assented Archer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no. It wasn't either, come to think of it," said
                Nora. "Don't you remember?

                He was a poet, you know."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's so," said Archer. "I do remember now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you think of Moses the Great?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think he was quite a man."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I guess he was quite a man. He conquered the whole
                world, you know,"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, I know it," said Archer, bobbing his head.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no," exclaimed Nora, "not quite all when we
                think about it. There was Elisha the Seventh, of Russia,
                beat him at Waterloo."
            </p>
            <p>
                "So he did," admitted Archer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How Moses the Great did run his horses to get
                away," pursued Nora, "full-blooded Hambletonians, too.
                They said they run awful."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They claim they scratched gravel to beat all," said
                Archer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can find pictures of all the great men in this
                history of the world," said Nora, bringing from one of the
                bookcases a large volume with morocco back and corners.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I like to look at pictures. Mrs. Warfle," said Archer,
                taking the history.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's see," said Nora, "they called Elisha the Seventh
                Giant Lishe, because he was such a great man to fight"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know they did," said Archer, "He was a tearer
                let loose."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Isn't it time to go to bed?" asked Manie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," answered Nora, "I'm not going to bed yet. Go
                on if you want to. I believe he was born in the year eight
                hundred and two. I think his greatest exploit was at the
                battle of Lundy's Lane, where he slew Olyppus the Tiger
                with his own hand. Let's see, was it one of his own
                officers that killed him?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't remember," said Archer. "I've had to work
                so hard lately that I ain't read much. But I was posted
                once."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, no," said Nora, "don't you remember? He was
                blown up by nitro-glycerine, blown to pieces so they
                couldn't find any of his body to burry?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's so, Mrs. Warfle," assented Archer. "He was
                teetotally smashed."
            </p>
            <p>
                The door suddenly opened and the staring visage of
                Mrs. Grippin was thrust inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nora," she exclaimed, "we've had enough Giant
                Lishe for to-night. Now you can poke straight to bed."
            </p>
            <p>
                Manie immediately rose to leave, and Nora, knowing
                that it was useless for her to argue, prepared to obey her
                aunt's orders. She went to the bookcase and slipped
                under her apron a novel, which she intended to read in her
                room. Archer, left to himself, turned over the pages of
                the history to see if he could find the portraits of the
                heroes whose merits he had been reviewing. He found
                many military scenes and many pictures of warriors
                whose heads were adorned with smooth helmets or jagged
                crowns. But in his search he was not confronted by the
                battle-scarred face of Moses the Great or Giant Lishe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Grippin soon came back and ordered him to prepare
                for the night's vigil. She blew out the light, told
                him to get in the corner designated by the major and
                bade him a final good-night.
            </p>
            <p>
                It chanced that the sofa was in that corner. Archer
                was tired. It occurred to him that he could watch as
                well reclining as erect. He laid the money on one end
                of the lounge, placed his coat on it and his head on the
                coat. The ticking of a small clock increased his
                drowsiness, and in five minutes he was asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                An hour later an intruder was in the room, carefully
                lifting Archer's head and removing the bag in his possession,
                when the eyes of the sleeper unclosed and Archer
                raised himself on his elbow. The robber dashed through
                the hall, running close to Nora, who was returning to the
                library with the book which she had taken. He entered
                the front bedroom and sprang through the open window,
                disappearing among the evergreens, just as Archer, who
                was now thoroughly awake, fired two shots after his retreating
                figure.

            </h2>
            <p>
"OH, dear! Oh, dear!" wailed Nora, throwing herself
on the floor. "What made you shoot? Oh, Mr.
Archer! What made you shoot?"
    </p>
    <p>
"I hit him!" cried Archer. "I know I did! I'll bet
a dollar I did!"
    </p>
    <p>
An instant later Ratke rushed to the scene of the disturbance
with his trousers in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
"What is it?" he exclaimed. "Is the money safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
"It's gone!" said Archer. "He went out of that window,
and I shot at him."
    </p>
    <p>
Like a school-boy the major jumped through the window
and ran down the walk. When he came to the gate,
he fancied he saw a man entering the shadow of the
horse-barn. He proceeded to the spot, but save himself,
no man was in sight. Near the straw-stack he drew on
his trousers, which he had till then unthinkingly retained
in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
"Get up from that floor, Nora," commanded Mrs.
Grippin.

"Oh, I can't" wailed Nora. "I never can get up.
Oh, dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
"Come," said Mrs. Grippin dragging her to her feet,
"I won't have you act so. Nobody is hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
"I wouldn't be in that fellow's boots for money, any
way," said Archer, tipping his head with an expression
of superior wisdom. "If he ain't got some cold lead in
him, he's a good one."
    </p>
    <p>
The men searched the barns and spread out over
the adjacent fields. Realizing that a crisis in their
employer's business affairs had come, they entered into the
hunt with a zeal which they had never manifested for farm
labor.
    </p>
    <p>
"It is of no use," said Ratke, as the morning drew near.
"The robber and the money are beyond our reach. Go
to the club-house and finish your sleep. I cannot give
it up yet, even though there is no hope."
    </p>
    <p>
Not one of the men would accept his offer. Unanimously
they agreed to stand by their employer in his
extremity, and to continue their efforts as long as there
was hope. Daggett went to Break o'Day, roused a
few of the inhabitants, and made such arrangements as
he thought were likely to lead to the recovery of the
major's stolen property. The remainder of the hands and
Ratke were ranging about in the swamp when the ringing
of the upright saw in the apple-tree summoned them to
breakfast. While they were in the kitchen washing,
Daggett returned.
    </p>
    <p>
The late misfortune filled the major with a dejection
which nothing but the precipitation of his trouble and
the destruction of his hopes could create. The Barton
hundred and sixty had gone; the homestead must go.
The study, the tool-house, the improvements which he
had made, were to be his but a day. He told the men
that they need not begin work that morning, as he would
like to see them in the club-house. When they had
gathered with many speculations as to the nature of his
announcement, he addressed them in a brief speech.
    </p>
    <p>
"My faithful men, it grieves me to communicate to you
what it is now necessary that you should know. For
years you have been in my service and have performed
well the tasks which I have given you. In every exigency
you have been my efficient helpers; to all my enterprises
you have lent cheerful aid. Distasteful as is the duty, I
must tell you that we can no longer maintain the relations
of employer and workmen. Another man holds the deed
of my farm of which he can take possession whenever he
desires. The money with which I could have temporarily
satisfied him and paid you has been stolen. I would
be doing you injustice if I allowed you to stay, when I
am uncertain that I can requite your honest labor. My
greatest trouble is that I am already owing you debts
which must for the present remain unpaid. I might have
avoided this. By leaving unfinished some of my projects
I could have given you your wages when they were due.
To think that I have wasted the substance which was
placed in my hands, to feel that it was not mine, but
yours, for you had earned it, is, indeed, the consummation
of my misery. But you shall not be defrauded. If I am
old, I am yet strong. I will work like a slave until you
are paid. My hands shall yet remunerate the honest
workmen whom my poor head has unintentionally cheated.
I will sell my stock, my farming implements, my breakfast
furniture. My creditors shall have their just dues, and
you shall be first remembered."
    </p>
    <p>
At the close of his speech the men crowded around him
with expressions of sympathy. They assured him that
they did not care for their pay. It was nothing compared
to his loss. If he needed help, they would work for
him all the summer and fall, and they would not charge
a cent.
    </p>
    <p>
"No," said the major, "I can take no such sacrifice.
You have lost enough through me."
    </p>
    <p>
"This is a sorry day, boys," said Daggett, as they were
packing their trunks and valises. "The major's unfinished
up. I believe it'll kill him. Did you notice how down
in the mouth he looked? If I had it to do over again,
I'd put in some rattling days' work for that old man."
    </p>
    <p>
Daggett, wishing a home until he could find work,
went to live with Osborne, to whose wife he was related.
The other men Ratke persuaded to stay to dinner, but at
one o'clock none of them were on the farm. Ratke sat
in a rocking-chair with his chin resting on his hand and
his left leg thrown over the chair-arm. In this position
he had studied out most of his inventions.
    </p>
    <p>
"Now, I wouldn't mope, James," said Mrs. Grippin.
"There's no use of your giving up."
    </p>
    <p>
"Give up?" answered the major, jerking his head from
his hand, "not while I live. Misfortune may beat me
down, may trample on me, may break my bones, but it
shall not conquer me. I am not discouraged; I am thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
Ratke's despondency was greater than he would admit.
    </p>
    <p>
As he rocked back and forth, no reflections would come,
except those of the most gloomy character.
    </p>
    <p>
"Uncle James," said Manie, thinking to divert his
mind from his trouble, "we have a great deal of
difficulty with the churning. I wish you would invent a
churn for me."
    </p>
    <p>
"That I will, my little girl," said the major, again
taking his hand from his chin. "Leave me alone awhile.
I want to think."
    </p>
    <p>
"I have it, Manie!" he exclaimed at the expiration of
half an hour. "I have the plan of an invention which
will preserve the grain of the butter as well as the swing
churn and do the quickest work which is done except by
steam or water power. It is a dasher which gives the
cream the rotary motion of the swing churn."
    </p>
    <p>
"James," interrupted Mrs. Grippin, "you don't know
when we'll have to leave here. You better fill up all our
ticks with new straw."
    </p>
    <p>
"Very well," said the major, rising at once.
    </p>
    <p>
He was nearly to the tool-house when Mrs. Grippin
called after him, "Why, James Ratke, what do you
want that coat on for this hot day? I should think you'd
roast."
    </p>
    <p>
"I should be more comfortable with it off," said Ratke,
who was too miserable to think of petty physical
comforts. He went to the stack and pulled out some straw
I before he reflected that he had forgotten the ticks. He
returned to the house and brought them out, one by one.
Then he thoughtlessly emptied them near the path. Mrs.
Grippin came to the door, expressed her displeasure at
his act and advised him to take a wheel-barrow to carry
back the filled ticks. Partly understanding her injunction,
he took the wheel-barrow and brought several loads of
straw near the pile of ticks.
    </p>
    <p>
"Take the ticks out to the straw-stack," called the
housekeeper. "You're scattering the straw all over the
yard."
    </p>
    <p>
Ratke meekly obeyed. He pulled the straw with no
thought of what he was doing. He had tried to rivet his
attention on the projected churn, but that was for any
considerable length of time impossible. He was continually
reminded of the farm whose ownership he had
allowed to be wrested from him. He missed the clumsy
jokes of the men. Archer's monotonous song was not
echoing from a distant field. No teams were at work on
his fallow. Stagnation had come to his enterprises, his
energies, his hopes; and ambition, its clamor for food
disregarded, had suddenly died.
    </p>
    <p>
"Right at it, Major," said the hearty voice of
Durgenson. "I suppose the women got you into that."
    </p>
    <p>
"Yes," said Ratke, straightening from his stooping
posture over a tick. "You are rather late, Durgenson."
    </p>
    <p>
"Yes," said the cattle-buyer, "but you see, I had
business so I couldn't come. I hope I haven't made
you any trouble by it. Has it made any difference to
you?"
    </p>
    <p>
"A great difference to both of us," answered Ratke.
"The money I had for you was stolen last night."
    </p>
    <p>
"What!" ejaculated Durgenson with genuine disappointment.
"Stole! I wouldn't think you'd have let it
got stole."
    </p>
    <p>
"I was up until nearly morning night before last,"
explained the major, "and last night I had one of my men
act as guard. He slept at his post, and the thief came
through a window, took the money and got away, I wish
you had come yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
"Well, I didn't," said Durgenson testily, "and I
couldn't. What are you going to do about it? I've got to
have something right away."
    </p>
    <p>
"There is nothing I can do," replied Ratke. "I am at
your mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
"Oh, I won't be hard," said Durgenson. "All I want
is what is fair. You can scrape me up a little, maybe,
and I can wait on you for the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
"There is no more scraping to be done," said the major,
"I have paid you all I can."
    </p>
    <p>
"You have a fair horse there," said Durgenson. "I'll
take him and allow you a thousand dollars for him."
    </p>
    <p>
"I cannot possibly do that," said Ratke.
    </p>
    <p>
"And why not?" asked Durgenson. "I've got to have
something if I wait, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
"I owe some debts for farm machinery," said Ratke.
    </p>
    <p>
"I owe four hundred dollars to the man of whom I bought
Taylor, and I owe my men some hundreds of dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
"You can stave them off," said Durgenson, "Of course,
they haven't any security, I wouldn't pay them a cent
when I was so hard up. I'd wait till I was in better
circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
"They must be paid," said the major emphatically, "I
promised it to them, and they must have it if I fast."
    </p>
    <p>
"But your men," said Durgenson, "they'd wait on you
a spell."
    </p>
    <p>
"The laborer is worthy of his hire," said Ratke. "My
men shall be paid before another creditor has the first
dollar."
    </p>
    <p>
"You want me to wait until you pay everybody else,"
cried Durgenson angrily. "You can understand now that
I won't do it. You promised me four thousand dollars,
and I'm going to have something, or I'll shove you off the
place."
    </p>
    <p>
"I am not to blame because you failed to come yesterday,"
said Ratke. "Neither am I to blame because of
the theft. Neither am I to blame for wishing to pay my
honest hired men first of all."
    </p>
    <p>
"Just as you like," returned Durgenson in a fury. "I'll
send a man in the morning to shove you out into the
street! Your promises are a waste of wind. You've
fooled me all you are going to. I did think you was
honest."
    </p>
    <p>
"Do you mean to say, you liar," cried the major, "that
I misrepresented to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
"What!" exclaimed Durgenson. "Don't you call me
a liar! I won't take that from any man!"
    </p>
    <p>
"You are a liar!" said Ratke, advancing and peering
into the face of the cattle-buyer. "This is my place for
to-day. Now go, or I will kick you off the premises! And
do not say one word in leaving! Not one word," he 
continued, as Durgenson's lips moved.
    </p>
    <p>
Durgenson turned and moved slowly toward the road.
    </p>
    <p>
"Faster!" commanded Ratke, following close at his
heels.
    </p>
    <p>
Durgenson quickened his pace, climbed hastily over the
fence and stopped in the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
"Come over here if you want to fight!" he said. "Come
right over here if you dare!"
    </p>
    <p>
Durgenson, in the prime of manhood, large and athletic,
contrasted strongly with the haggard, white-haired old man
who promptly climbed the fence to accept his challenge.
Unfastening the top button of his coat and drawing from
the garment his right arm, he stood undecided whether
to give or to decline battle. As Ratke advanced with an
expression of determination, he slipped his arm inside the
coat and fastened the button, at the same time saying,
    </p>
    <p>
"I won't be guilty of fighting with an old man."
    </p>
    <p>
"Never mind the guilt," said the wrathful major.
"You must either fight or leave, and that immediately,"
    </p>
    <p>
"I don't like trouble," said Durgenson, making for his
buggy. "I'll have you out of here to-morrow," he called,
when he had got his horse under a round trot. "You've
lied to me all I'm going to stand."
    </p>
    <p>
"You ought to have licked him," said Mrs. Grippin,
who with the girls had come to the gate, afraid that the
major might be harmed by the stalwart cattle-buyer.
    </p>
    <p>
"I will not chase a man to fight," said Ratke. "Maria,
do you know where the cradle is? The reaper is broken,
and the oats must be cut."
    </p>
    <p>
"No, I don't," said Mrs. Grippin. "You can't cradle.
You never learned how. You had better get some one
to cradle them, and you bind them up."
    </p>
    <p>
"I have no money to hire," said the major. "I must
do the work myself. Manie, have you seen the cradle?"
    </p>
    <p>
"Yes," said Manie, " I saw it under the wagon shed.
Let me go to Mr. Osborne's and get Mark to cut it,
Uncle James. He will wait for his pay till you thresh the
oats."
    </p>
    <p>
I am afraid to run in debt any more," said Ratke.
I will do the work alone."
    </p>
    <p>
Resolutely he went out to the shed and took down the
old turkey-wing cradle, which cut a very wide swath, and
was intended to be used by a strong man. He was unused
to the work, but he had cared for his health; and
his strokes, though poorly directed, were vigorous. He
could not keep from hitting the ground with the scythe.
    </p>
    <p>
The old turkey-wing struck in high and, like a hawk,
swooped down on the outer edge of the swath. Undiscouraged
by his awkwardness, he whipped the cradle back and
forth, making good time in spite of all difficulties. His
face was covered with sweat, he was much fatigued and
the upper part of his right fore-arm pained him excessively,
yet he did not stop till near sundown. Weary, lame and
disconsolate, he went to the house, where he found waiting
the supper which he had no desire to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
"I must go at the chores," he said. "I had forgotten
them."
    </p>
    <p>
"No, you don't want to go at any chores," said Mrs.
Grippin, "You ought to know when you've done enough.
You stay here, and Manie and I will do the chores.
Act as though you had some sense. You don't want
to be sick. I'll milk the cows, and Manie can look to the
horses."
    </p>
    <p>
"I'll help," volunteered Nora, who was strangely sober.
"I'll milk part of the cows. Aunt Maria."
    </p>
    <p>
"We'll go right out," said Mrs. Grippin stepping to the
kitchen." Nora, where did you put those pails?"
    </p>
    <p>
"I left them on the shelves," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
"No, you didn't," said Mrs. Grippin. "They're not
here. We'll have to take the water pails. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
Near the barnyard they heard the sound of milk going
into a tin pail, and, opening the gate, they saw that Daggett
was stripping the last cow.
    </p>
    <p>
"Why!" exclaimed Mrs. Grippin, "It was you that
got the pails, Mark."
    </p>
    <p>
"Yes," said Daggett, "I looked over this way, and I
got homesick. I wanted to come and chore around the
old barn once more."
    </p>
    <p>
"I'm ever so much obliged to you," said Mrs. Grippin.
"I hope I can make this up to you, Mark."
    </p>
    <p>
"I don't want it made up," said Daggett. "How's the
major?"
    </p>
    <p>
"He's about sick, and I'm afraid he's going to be.
Durgenson was here to-day and talked hard to him.
He's going to put us off to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
"We'll be right on hand if he tries that," said Daggett
impetuously, "every man of us. We'll make him and
his crowd wish they was somewhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
That night the major was restless. Harassed, overworked
and overheated, he tossed from side to side in his
efforts to find an easy posture. His head throbbed and
became the seat of a dull pain. A strange roaring sound
was in his ears, but, when he sat up in bed, it ceased.
After it had several times recurred, and been dispelled by
his assuming an erect position he gave up his attempts to
discover its cause. The roaring grew so loud that he
again rose to see if it were really an illusion. This time
he was astonished to hear the unmistakable crackling of
flames and to see sparks of fire flying past his window.
