ings which had been erected on his former farm. The
windows of the house threw back among the apple trees,
by which it was partly hidden, the rays of the sun, whose
splendid reflections glimmered like wondrous lanterns
among the branches. From Green's woods, which were
red and yellow in the cloak of fall, came the voice of
William Henry Harrison, who was calling the cows. A
night-hawk swept high over the major's head, carry-
ing its mournful cry over his desolated and rebuilded
homestead.

He opened the door of the shop and entered. Inside
were a few tools which had been left by ibe blacksmith
who had previously owned the lot. These were a work-
bench, an anvil, two saw-horses and two hammers. The
blacksmith evidently had worked some in wood ; and, in
fact, such was the case, for he had been exorbitant in his
charges, and his trade afforded him but a meager sub-

sistence. On the workbench was Ratke's one-man saw,
which was badly rusted. Taking a hammer, the major
loosened the saw-blade from the frame and fastened it
with a strap to a strong hickory pole, the upper part of
which he nailed firmly to the wall. He tied a small rope
to the other end of the saw and pulling it until the stiff
pole bent far back, he made it fast to a ring in the opposite
wall, leaving the saw stretched horizontally within about
two feet of the- floor. His next movement was to place
nearly under the saw a saw-horse on which he rested his
head so that his throat was within a few inches of the
sharp saw-teeth. Satisfied that the arrangements for
suicide were complete, he arose to take his farewell of
terrestrial things.

Once more he stepped out into the cool evening air.
The sun had disappeared, and its light had ceased to tint
the clouds along the western horizon, but it was reflected
from the stray patches which were moving slowly near the

"Ah," he said, " the cloud at the horizon is as red as
the one at the zenith. It does not appear so to me, be-
cause I am not in a proper position to see its brilliancy.
If the light of merit has fallen on me and my inven-
lions, the world has not been in a situation to recognize
it."

To no purpose had his philcsophy been neglected ; at

of which were a fitting preliminary to the approaching
tragedy. In the morning, or, perhaps, that night, they
would find him with his throat hacked and, it might be,
entirely cut in twain. He crawled under the saw and
rested his head on the saw-horse. He raised a scythe to
strike a blow which would allow the hickory spring to pull
the saw across his throat.

Some one jerked him back, tipping over the saw-horse.
Manie's arms were about his neck, her face close to his,
her soothing voice in his ear. After pulling him gently
away she struck the rope with the scythe. The vicious
force with which the spring propelled the saw showed
how deadly an implement of destruction the major had
planned.

"What made you interrupt me ? " cried the major.
"The world has no use for James Ratke ! Wherever I
am, I*am in the way. I am refuse in the economy of
Nature, refuse which her creatures abhor, but which she
will not remove. I will remove myself ! Go away,
Manie ! Go away, I tell you ! "

"Uncle James, Uncle James," pleaded Manie, " do not
act so ! Come into the house."

"You, too, have become my enemy," said Ratke. " No
friend of mine would like to prolong my wretched existence.
I thought that I had suffered until I had no further capacity
for suffering, but sensation only slept. It racks me now
as it racked me before my mind fell into torpidity, when
I sat on the log watching my burning wagon. Oh, Manie I
Must I, must I fall into that stupor again \ Must I, my
God ! Must I see my mind, like my fortunes, waste away,
leaving me a wreck and a wretch indeed ? "

"Trust in God," said Manie. " He can rescue you
from any trouble."

"God ! " echoed the major, " God has deserted me
utterly ; utterly, utterly," he added with an accent of in-
cescribable despair. " Where is my farm on which I prided
myself ? Where are my horses and cattle ? Where are
my books, which were my study and my comfort ? Where
are my inventions, which I would have given my life to
save ? Where is Trace, the trusted son of my comrade,
whom I loved better than myself? His mutilated body

is in that graveyard I He died in destroying my all ! li
I could forget ! If I only could 1 ' The waters'are come
in unto my soul.' "

"Come in," said Manie, pulling him toward the door.

The major went passively to the house, where Manie
induced him to be seated. " ' The Lord will not cast off
forever,' " she said, " ' but, though he cause grief yet will
he have compassion, according to the multitude of his
mercies.' "

"You talk of consolation," replied Ratke, rising from
his chair and striding restlessly about the room. " There
is no consolation for me. ' The sorrows of death compass
me.' I will not take my wretched life to-night, because I
could take only the bodily part. I would I could place
those saw teeth against my soul ! I would annihilate my-
self, for I could meet annihilation firmly. This old body
I can bring to the grave, but I cannot touch the after
life. No. I must keep this sensation, sensation which
gives me no pleasure, only pain, eternal pain, I am like
an old harp which was once an instrument of melody, but
which now yields the harshest of sounds. Mirth, pleasure,
rest, they are for me neither now nor in eternity ! "

"You have no reason to be so hopeless," said Manie. 
"God has promised to help those who trust in Him.
' Whoso hearkeneth unto Me shall dwell safely and shaW
be quiet from fear of evil.'

"' He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of
the afflicted, neither hath He hid his face from him. But
when he cried unto Him, He heard.' "

"What have I rendered unto Him in my prosperity,"
said Jialke, " that He should help me now ? I never open-
ly acknowledged Him, When wealth and friends were
mine, I depended on my own resources with little solici-
tude for God's assistance. I said, ' I will get wisdom ; '
and that wisdom I worshipped. Now, when all my per-
secutors have overtaken me between the straights, he has
left me to be extricated by my wisdom."

"You have fulfilled part of the Lord's requirements,"
said Manie. " ' Is not this the fast that I have chosen, to
loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens
and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every

yoke ? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that
thou bririg the poor that are cast out to thy house, when
thou seest the naked that thou cover him ? ' "

"It was not enough," answered the major, " or I should
have support in this hour. He laughs at my calamity.
'He hath thrown down and hath not pitied.' 'He hath
made me desolate and faint all the day.' I might call,
but he would not answer. Oh, Manie, how can I live?
' My heart is like wax ! '"

"You will feel better to-morrow," said Manie. " When
I am teaching school, we shall have more money. We
will pay up these little debts, and how much comfort we
will take, reading our books and studying together. We
will get some tools In the shop for you. Uncle James,
and you can work at your inventions as you used to
do."

"I shall never know comfort again," said Ratke. " Is
it nothing to lose one's entire possessions, to see perishing
what one prizes more than property, to see wealth, posi-
tion, friendships, aspirations, all shivered in succession,
and the ruins heaped in ashes on one's head ? My
neighbors who have given me financial help laugh
 at me. They sneer at my Jerusalem wagon and crack
jokes about my one-man saw. I cannot endure it. I
shall die or go insane. ' The pains of hell have got hold
upon me.' "

"' The sorrows of hell compassed me about,' " said
Manie. " ' The snares of death prevented me. In my
distress I called on the Lord and my cry came before him,
even unto his ears.'"

"My sighs are many, and my heart is faint," said the
major. " There is anguish in reflection. Lure me into
forgetfulness by song, Manie."

"Shall I sing one which John composed ? " asked
Manie.

"Anything," answered Ratke. " Sit close by me."

The room was quite dark, for Manie had not yet lighted
a lamp. She seated herself by Ratke, who had ceased
his violent pacino" of the floor. The scene through
which sAe Aac? Oacsed put a tremulous pathos into her
vojce. fi^-'

"A minstrel sang often Euterpa's gay song

Where the board of the feast was outspread,
Where the floor of the hall 'neath a great courtly throng

Bent and swayed to the dancers' light tread.
Sweet notes which were welcomed, applauded and famed

Came from the musicians' skilled art.

But it touched not a comfortless hearL

Those who in his prosperous days
Were loudest in flattery scoffed at his lay.

And hushed was their liberal praise.
He thought of his laurels, whose life was so brief,

In his gloomy and utter despair
No hand was extended to give him relief.
' My burden,' he faltered, in accents of grief,

' Is greater than I can bear.'

"He bowed low his head and he threw down his tyre

In a hall where its music had rung.
He felt that forever had left him that fire

With which in his youth he had sung.
Oh, deep was the anguish that swept ever him then

When no solace his broken heart propped ;
He mused on his trouble, remote from all men;
But mournfully from its mute corner again

He picked up the lyre he had dropped.

"Out on the wide world the sad measure was borne,
And the healing of pain was its goal.
It came from a bosom by misery torn ;



And men from the shades of their crimes were beguiled ;

"Comb my hair, Manie," said the major. " Sit on my
knee and comb my hair. Let me think that these are the
olden days, that you are a little girl, that I have not lost
my place, that I still have hope for my inventions. Oh,
this is luxury ! What a soothing power there is in the
comb."

Manie, who was crying under cover of the darkness,
tenderly combed and brushed his hair.

CHAPTER XXXII.



LIBER SEXTUS.



The voice which John heard was silent after its one
outburst. He could find for the words no logical con-
nection with any present event. An inquiry in the nine-
teeth century concerning an individual of an ancient
German nation was a circumstance which he could not
understand. It might be a quotation which some one
was reciting in a tragical manner or the exclamation of a
lunatic whose bewildered faculties were roaming through
European barbaric history. The latter supposition
seemed the more likely, for a practicing declaimer would
not content himself with the repetition of a single sen-
tence.

John presently heard the tones of a female in the lower
part of the house who was complaining bitterly of some
grievance. " I tell you I won't," she cried. " I won't
have them here, so many of them, without letting them
know they ain't* welcome. This is my house, or as good
as my house, and you needn't say a word more about
it."

John began to feel positive alarm. He mistrusted
that Durgenson had entrapped him into a mad-house, for
what purpose he could not decide. He knew, however,
on reflection that if it were a public institution, he could
demonstrate his sanity, when he would at once be set free.
But if it were not a refuge for the insane, what meant the
strange language, especially that sonorous voice which
had so startled him.

To satisfy himself that he was not a prisoner he went
to the one window of the room, which he endeavored to
open, but which resisted his efforts. The blinds were
closed and fastened, he did not doubt, in such a manner
as to defy anything less than a great expenditure of force.




THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK O' DA Y. 307

He did not yet desire an escape ardently enough to
shatter the window and the blinds. There was probably
no way of descent to the ground, except by leaping; and
in case he failed to find a reasonably safe method of exit,
the violence he contemplated would bring him disagree-
able consequences, whether he were in the hands of
friends or of enemies. Notwithstanding its disadvantages
he would in all likelihood have attempted a flight from
the window, had he not still clung to the hope of realizing
some benefit from his visit. Panicky had told him he
could not afford to stay away from this place for all the
wealth in Ann Arbor,

He seated himself in a chair and waited. Footsteps,
evidently those of a woman, were ascending the stairs.
A key turned in the lock of the door, which opened, and
a light shone into the room.

"Come this way," authoritatively said the woman who
had conducted him to the chamber.

"Very well," answered John, " but before you lock me
up again as if I were a convict, I wish to know what I
have done to merit such treatment, I am used to being
my own master."

"Excuse me if I have appeared rude," said the woman,
"What I have done, I have done for your good. You
will acknowledge it to-morrow. Do as I tell you, and I
will soon explain everything to your satisfaction."

This speech, though it silenced John and partly quieted
his displeasure, was said in a manner not in the least
apologetic.

Not far from the bottom of the stairs she opened a

shelves was devoted to history and bic^raphy, another to
theoretical and miscellaneous works, and the third con-
tained, besides such as were included in the second, poetry
and light literature. In the historical department the
works of ancient nations were at the bottom and the
chronology of the subject matter in each volume was
more modern than that in the book underneath it. The
bottom shelves of the theoretical and miscellaneous de-
partment were occupied by books of reference, such as
dictionaries, cyclopedias, etc. Above them, in order, were
religious, philosophical and political treatises and various
odd and antiquated dissertations. The legal and polit-
ical works occupied the greater number of the shelves in
the theoretical division, and usurped more than half the
space in the third department. The imaginative Uterature,
alone, of all the library, showed signsof disarrangement.
Poems and novels were mingled in confusion. Scott's
Waverlies were scattered about on every shelf. It was as
if the library had been once arranged by a careful student,
and afterward abandoned to some slovenly, trivial-minded
person, who had left the solid part undisturbed. The one
wall which did not support book-shelves was pasted over
with newspaper clippings, which were mostly political
articles or items concerning distinguished men. On this
side of the apartment was a secretary divided into small
drawers, some of whose labels are here quoted :" " War
Measures," " Reconstruction," " Currency,"

A step close to the door and a suspension of the sound
notified John that some person was near him.

"Say," began John, " how much longer am I to stay in

"How do I know ? " said Durgenson. " I didn't put
you in there."

"But you sent for me to come here," returned John.

"I have been abused. That woman has a fashion of

locking the door every time she leaves me. I will not

endure it much Jong^r. You must inform me soon what

you wish of tn<i^ j- I will kick out the window and go."

. " / don't bJ^L yfju a bit," said Durgenson. " That's

"We have made careful inquiries about you," said
Mrs. Baldwin, " and we are satined that we know your
family history. Will you please bare your foot ? Which
one, Mrs. Boyle ? "

"That one," said Mrs. Boyle, pointing to the left

"It is very sore," returned John. " I have had a sur-
gical operation performed on it. Still, 1 will do as you
say."

"What kind of operation ? " asked Mrs, Baldwin.

"There were six toes," replied John, " and I had one
of them amputated,"

"What," cried Mrs. Baldwin, " amputated ? You
foolish boy ! Do you know you have lost the most
honorable birth-mark there is in Michigan ? What are
we to do, now that the proof of your descent is gone ?
You saw it, though, Mrs. Boyle ? "

"Yes," said Mrs. Boyle. " I will swear to that."

"The doctors at Ann Arbor will testify to the same
thing," said John, " and the scar where the toe was will
always stay on my foot."

"1 will tell you some things which, perhaps, you would
like to know," said Mrs. Baldwin, as John was replacing
the bandages on his foot. " Vour grandfather was a man
of weaith and influence."

"Is he dead ? " asked John excitedly.

"Vou must not interrupt me," said Mrs. Baldwin.
"Your mother went to Detroit to school, and while there
became acquainted with a young German named Leh-
mann. Mr. Lehmann and your grandfather, meeting ac-
cidentally, quarreled over politics. Your grandfather, on
finding out that the young gentleman who wished to marry
his daughter, was the one with whom he had disagreed,
told him never to enter his house. A while after that
your mother, in spite of the quarrel, married Mr, Leh-
mann. Your grandfather was, of course, very indignant,
and they were never reconciled. Your parents went to

father and motlier started to go to Milwaukee, where he
was advertised to play. Both of them were killed in the



312 THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK o'Day.

"She moved to Michigan. A few weeks ago you came
to her house, and she was struck by your strong resem-
blance to your father. When you played on your violin,
she was almost certain of your identity. Remembering
how Mr. Durgenson had tried to get possession of you
twenty years before, she warned you to have nothing to do
with him. After you sprained your ankle and she saw
your foot, she was certain who you were.

"Your grandfather met with an accident in Jackson
County, when the story of your mother's elopement was
again told through the country. Mrs. Boyle, hearing it,
wrote to us what she knew about the affair. I got a law-
yer to interview Dabney. The lawyer frightened him
into telling that it was he who took you from Mrs. Boyle.
He says Mr. Durgenson hired him to kill you. He did
not want to do that, but he was in sore need of money,
and he did take you to his brother's house out in the
country, where you were kept for several weeks, Durgen-
son all the while believing you dead. If you had been a
rich man's son, you would have been found. As it was,
the police took little pains to hunt you up. In a little
while Dabney, who was careful that you should not be
hurt, took you to Michigan and left you with a relative of
the boy who was living with Mrs. Boyle. That is the
way you came by your name of Wrengell."

"Then," remarked John, " the history of which I have
been so much ashamed is the history of Alf, the fellow
who was with Mrs. Boyle. I have hung my head for the
depravity of his parents." He felt a great thrill of thank-
fulness as he reflected that Wrengell, his tormentor at
Ann Arbor, with his sand-colored coat, his wicked mouth
and his criminal face was not his relative.

"We told Dabney," said Mrs. Baldwin, " that if he
would find you and identify you, we would pardon him
for what he had done and reward him besides. He was
glad to repair the mischief he had accomplished. He
said he had seen you but a short time before, and he could
soon find you. You know how he kept his word."

"Who was my grandfather ? " asked John.

"I will show you his picture," replied Mrs. Baldwin.
"Come into this room."



THE CHRONICLES OF BREAK O" DAY. 313

They passed into an apartment which was well, though
not luxuriously, furnished. Mrs. Baldwin pointed to a
frame, which enclosed the stern, intellectual face of Sena-
tor Mallard. John felt his legs tremble and his heart
throb. Sinking info a chair, incapable of speech, he
covered his face with his hands, while the tears trickled
through his fingers and ran down his coat-sleeves.
Poverty and disgrace, where were they now ? Of his
wealth he knew nothing and cared little, but his lineage
was proud enough to satisfj' even his ambition,

"Let me see him," he said in a broken voice. " I want
to see my grandfather."

"We will go to him now," said Mrs. Baldwin. "He
was thrown from a buggy in Jackson County, and he can-

Mrs, Baldwin followed Durgenson.

"Suebian," said Mallard, " I have Ihe key to the past
For years I tried in vain to master its secrets. Now they
come to ipe without any effort on my part. Time, you
know, circles around us and every year draws a coil. My
head has whirled and unwound the coil, unwound two
thousand years. I have learned every incident in the his-
tory of the Suebi, incidents to which historians have never
referred."

"Here is a violin," said Mrs. Baldwin, as she ap-
proached with the instrument which she named. " Play
for your grandfather."

When John's music had ceased, Mallard said, " I hear
Orpheus playing on his golden harp to win Eurydice from
the king of the dead. Cerberus has sunk to sleep, and
the fiery wheel on which Ixion is bound stands still. No,
my head has whirled and carried me back too far. That
strain never floated in the land of the dead or over the
Thessalian hills. Thou art a Suebian,"

"The rigor of thy clime hath saddened thee," said the
old man at the conclusion of another air by John. " This
is the wail of the terrible north wind, lying flat on his face
and piling mountains of ice on thy desolate islands and
across the mouths of thy slow rivers. Thou couldst not
translate his language until he drove mirth from thee."

By Mrs. Baldwin's direction John again took his bow
and played.

"Strange things are in thy forest of Bacinis," said Mal-
lard. " In thy wanderings through the wood thou hast
seen visions of the unattainable and hast overtaken the
sublime. I, too, have seen sublimity, but I could not
catch it. I thought to grapple it and hold it up to the gaze
of men, and, when I reached out my hand for it, it was
gone. Give it to me, that I may unfold it before the

THE CHRONTCLES OF BREAK O" DA Y. 315

"No," answered Mrs. Baldwin, "of course there are
not. Vou are lying on a mattress."

"That is not what I meant," said the Senator, " there
are chickens, live chickens in this bed.  There ! See
that one running to the foot."

"I will drive them out," said Mrs. Baldwin, who dis-
appeared through the door and speedily returned with a
broom. " Shoo, shoo,'' she cried, striking the bed vigor-
ously with the household utensil.

"Stop," commanded Mallard, " Do not hurt them.
They have all gone. Suebian, come nearer. I will tell
thy fortune."

John advanced and held out his hand.

"No," said Maliard. " Bunglers tell fortunes by the
hand. I tell them by the foot. Strip ofl these bandages."

The Senator stirred around uneasily, getting the quilt
which was over him partly displaced, when it became ap-
parent that he had twelve toes, six on each foot. John,
while he was undoing the bandages, looked with regret
at the mutilation which he had caused, and reflected that
he would give much to replace the lost member in its
normal state. He turned his chair toward the bed, pre-
senting the limb with its scabbed extremity as his grand-
father had desired.

"Here are the archives of the past and the indices of
the future," said the statesman. " Six toes, and every toe
a book. Here are Liber Primus, Liber Secundus, Liber
Tertius, Liber Quartus, Liber Quintus, and, what is
this ? Liber Sextos is gone ; dids't thou willingly part
-vith it?"

"I would 1 had it back," said John earnestly.

"Liber Sextus is a grand book," said Mallard, " It tells
the story of the Suebi and the Roman Usurpation. Still,
I can read it when it is absent as well as when it is pres-
ent. The Roman will contend against thee. Entangle
him in the marshes, and remain thyself on the hills. If
my head would only keep stationary, I could decipher all ;
but just as I am introduced to an epoch, it whirls again,
and events ily out of my sight."

"He is getting tired," said Mrs. Baldwin. " We had
better go and let him rest."



3l6 THE CHK0N2CLES OF BREAK O' DA Y.

"Farewell, Suebian," said Mallard, when he saw them
leaving his presence. " Be firm in resisting the Roman."

"Do you have watchers for him nights ? " asked John
as he, Mrs. Baldwin and Mrs. Boyle were in the room
which contained the large picture of his grandfather.

"No," replied Mrs. Baldwin, " we did for a while, until
he said so much against it. He could not bear to have
any one in his room when he wanted to go lo sleep.
When you wish to go to bed, I will show you your room."

"I will retire now," said John.

Mrs. Baldwin led the way up the stairs to a bedroom in
the north extremity of the house. Through the window
John could see the glimmering lights of the wakeful city,
which at the horizon appeared to join the star-dotted
spread of the heavens. His happiness had come in a del-
uge, which he was ill-fitted quietly to withstand. There
was no obstacle to his union with Manie. None could
sneer at the parentage of Martin Lehraann's son and Sen-
ator Mallard's grandson. He undressed and went to bed,
but the exuberance of his spirits forbade him to be still.
For an hour or two he resisted the inclination to rise.
Finally, however, it grew too strong to be suppressed,
when he sprang up and put on his clothes. Few lights
were now visible in the city. John sat in a chair, or
paced back and forth until the sunbeams fell on the
clustered roofs at the north.

He softly descended the stairs to take a look at his
grandfather, who, he thought, might not be awake.
Cautiously pushing open the bedroom door, which was
ajar, he peered inside. Mallard's white face was turned
toward him, the eyes were closed, the lips were parted
as if in sleep, but never more would they charm a won-
dering senate or move to the accents of popular eloquence.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

THE HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF.

Of the obsequies of Senator Mallard it is necessary to
say little. They were conducted with imposing cere-
monies and attended by many of his associates in the
Senate.

After the funeral Mrs. Boyle returned to her home.
The question of heirship was some time in being satis-
factorily settled. Durgenson's wife, who, as has been
stated, was Mallard's niece, would not recognize John's
right to the property. She and her husband lived in one
part of the house, and John and Mrs. Baldwin in another.

"I tell you," said Mrs. Baldwin to John one day, " we
want to look out for Durgenson. ??? He is anxious to get
you out of his way and has been ever since you were born.
That night when you were at Mrs. Boyle's, I believe, just
as much as I believe anything, that he meant to kill you
when you went to look at the horse."

"How could he harm us ? " asked John.

"By putting poison in the water we drink, or in our
food," replied Mrs. Baldwin. " I tell you, John, we had
better not stay in the same house with them. You don't
know anything about him. He is so treacherous. You
remember how he tried to get you away from us. I haven't
the least doubt that he meant to lure you to some out-of-
the-way place and kill you. One house is not large enough
for that family and us."

"What are we to do until the estate is settled ? " asked
John.

"Get them out of the house, or go ourselves," answered
Mrs. Baldwin.

"How can we do that ? " inquired John.

"If we cannot eject them by legal process, let us leave,"
said Mrs. Baldwin.

care of him. I knew they were looking after the property
they expected to get. George was not in his right mind,
and I could not turn them out, for Mrs. Durgenson was
more nearly related to him than I. So, you see, nothing
could be done. George did not fancy them, but, if he ex-

like to see him as soon as he comes. In the mean time
you will please leave the household articles in their present
places until the settlement of the estate."

Mrs. Durgenson again tipped her head to one side, this
time in defiance. The servant once more turned her
broom toward John, and, suppressing a giggle, sent the
dirt flying about him in profusion.

"Oh," thought John, " we have met before."

"Oblige me by telling Mr. Durgenson of ray visit," he
said, " and inform him that I would like to see him at the
earliest opportunity."

"I ain't used to being a servant," said Mrs. Durgen-
son. " You'll have to see him yourself. Jule, there's
some dirt in that corner."

"Yes," said Julia Wallace, filling the air with floating
particles, which she energetically directed for John's
inhalation.

"Good-morning," said John, passing through the door.

Mrs. Durgenson and her servant exchanged glances
and tittered, and, when John had gone a few steps, burst
into loud laughter.

"The idea," said Mrs. Durgenson, purposely elevating
her tone so. that it could be heard by her late visitor, " of
a man of his birth telling me what to do with my prop-
erty that my uncle left me."

The ill-feeling between the two households was shared
by the servant-girls, and by them less repressed than by
their employers. Usually servants have the human
aversion to doing unnecessary work, but in this case the
general rule was inapplicable. Both Julia and Mrs. Bald-
win's Ellen were anxious to have .the care of as large a
share of the house as possible. The south parlor, the
hall and the library were the most frequent occasions of
rivalry. At the beginning of the war the girl who entered
the room first was allowed undisputed possession until
the renovation was completed. This tacit agreement
stimulated each hurriedly to wash the morning dishes in
order first to reach the contested field. Gradually they
rose earlier. By Mrs. Durgenson's permission Julia,
leaving her breakfast dishes unwashed, " stole a march "
on the hated Ellen. Next morning the enterprising Ellen,

resolved not to be beaten, swept the room before another
individual in the house was astir. Slurs, innuendoes and
directly personal remarks began to be used frequently by
both parties.

Although Ellen had a considerable amount of fighting
Irish blood, she was not as aggressive as Julia, who
seemed bent on precipitating a quarrel. The encroach-
ments on the rights of John and Mrs. Baldwin by Wal-
lace's proraising daughter, who, in truth, had more spirit
than her father or her brother, were annoying in the ex-
treme. She came to Ellen's kitchen and helped herself

'* 1*11 know it about next week," retorted Julia, bobbing
her head furiously and approaching Ellen, who backed
away with the kettle. " There ain't any Mr. Lehmann
here. That's John Wrengell, and he's a nobody. He
stole a horse and got chased out of Break o'Day. He
come to see me once. I told him to keep right away, for
I I wouldn't have anything to do with him, -- the scurf o'

the earth. Fd like to claw him."
' " I don't believe it," returned Ellen. " He wouldn't

look at you, nor the likes of you, you great freckled thing.
You've stole everything you could get your hands on, and
I I know you'd lie, too."

I " You miserable Irish amount-to-nothing," cried Julia,

advancing toward her, " you want to shut right up. Hand
I me that kettle in a hurry."

"What is all this about ? " asked Mrs. Baldwin, coming
to the relief of the frightened Ellen.

"She won't let me have that kettle," said Julia, " and
I'm a-going to have it. I ain't got a big kettle that fits
my cook-stove."

"We cannot spare that kettle," said Mrs. Baldwin.
"You must get along the best way you can."

"I ain't afraid of you both," said Julia. " Hand that
kettle here."

"Get out of this kitchen, or I will have you arrested,"
said John, suddenly appearing. " You have taken
things enough. I warn you not to molest this part of
the house."

"Oh, you low-lived galoot," said Julia, as she took her
