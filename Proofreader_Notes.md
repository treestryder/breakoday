## PLACES

Break o'Day is one of the oldest villages in Jackson
County. It had its store and its school-house before the
first building was erected in Sharptown or Oakville. The
derivation of its name has been the subject of many
inquiries, which have been answered by local antiquarians.
The founders of the hamlet, like the majority of Michigan
pioneers, came from New York. Four families built
their houses neat together, that they might enjoy the
society of neighbors. Others followed from the Empire
State, and the neighborhood became thinly settled. They
had dwelt on the eastern hills, where, unobstructed, a view
extended for miles. They were now in the midst of woods,
where they could view no distant object unless it were
above the timber. Month after month they lived in this
manner, and daily the complaints grew louder. The
women, who had been accustomed to habits of thrift,
longed to see the sun rise once more. They declared it
was nothing but laziness which allowed them to be penned
up in that fashion, that if they were men, they would chop
out at least one place wide enough to give them a sight
through the forest. Urged on by their wives, the men
made a bee and hewed to the eastward a road through
which the earliest beams of the daily luminary might shine.
The next morning the entire population of the locality
gathered to witness the blaze of light which slowly
appeared above the long stretch of stumps. Shouts
resounded, guns were fired, a feast was spread, and the
place was promptly named Break o'Day.

The village never grew to the dimensions which were
anticipated for it by its first builders. Twenty years ago
its appearance was substantially as it is to-day. It was
built on five corners from which ran roads, one to each
cardinal point of the compass and one southeast to Sharptown.
The greater part of the buildings were on the triangle formed
by the eastern and south-eastern streets and
the cross street which connected them. These streets were
named in order, Warren, Jackson and Washington. On
Warren were the church and the school-house; on Jackson,
Birch and Bigney's store and the hotel; on Washington,
the hardware store and the blacksmith-shop. Marion,
running northward, could boast only of dwelling-houses.
The drugstore of Dr. Rorus was the one building of
importance on the west road, which, on account of its
shade trees, the villagers named Maple Street, but which the
farmers in derision called Scrub Avenue. This edifice
was painted yellow, had a high square front, a shed roof,
and bore the following inscription, "I. J. H. Rorus,
M. D., Physician and Surgeon."


Am I still in Jefferson Township?
You're in Washtenaw, now, township of Warren."
"I wish to go to Break o'Day," said John.


## QUOTES

"I pay you for your time," returned Ratke. "When
you do as I tell you, it is my lookout if your service is
unprofitable. After this you use the tool I give you to work
with."

Article written in 1894 about this book: https://aadl.org/node/125251
__ Look at distributed proofing http://www.pgdp.net/c/


My great-great-great grandfather lived in the house just east of the Bunker Hill town hall. His name was George Washington Holland (1848-1922) and he wrote articles for the local papers under the pen name "Rough and Ready". Somehow his writings were used in the creation of the book 'The Chronicles of Break o' Day' by Edward Everett Howe.

It was copyrighted 1893 and the story starts "One March morning in 187---".

I read this book thinking Bunker Hill was the town named "Break O' Day", but after re-reading the following snippet I found in an Ingham County historical document, I realized that the backdrop of the story is near Webberville and the township just to the south of it.

"G. W. Holland was historian and poet laureate of Bunkerhill and other townships where he resided for forty years. After I876 he became the regular correspondent of the Ingham County Democrat and News, the Leslie Local, Stockbridge Sun and Lansing Sentinel. He was justice of the peace for twenty-two years, so could write from his court docket all kinds of stories. His pen name was "Rough and Ready," and he edited a set of stories about White Oak and Leroy townships, "Chronicles of Break O' Day." These were revised and made into a book by E. Everett Howe that had quite a sale. Four editions were published by Robert Smith Printing company." -- http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/micounty/ARH7656.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext

Google scanned the book at the U of M Library and it has a few rough patches. I would love to see someone, with more time than myself, clean it up. Maybe as part of the Gutenberg Project (http://gutenberg.org/).

# To Do
* _x Move detailed Transcriber's Note to the end.
* _x Remove Google's note.
* _x Find and share at submission the URL from which you downloaded the source scans/files in the copyright clearance form's Scans Archive field.
* _ Share at submission a Credit line in the upload form's Credit field.  A typical entry would be something like "Nathan Hartley from scans obtained from the Internet Archive".  Distributed Proofreaders includes this in their Credit line: "(This file was produced from images generously made available by the Internet Archive".  (PG's posting software prefixes "Thanks to" to whatever's in the field.
* _ Compress the cover, at over 11M, is far too large, file-size-wise.  Experimentally, I used Irfanview (https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irfanview.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259618302%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fm5XroLVRnM99%2Bq%2BkSFKr5xsrqVpYL7%2F5%2B3z4qxfMUk%3D&reserved=0) to reduce it to 30% of its original size (no other changes), reducing the file size from 11M to approximately 772K.
* _x Try submitting without the TXT file. Your text file isn't properly formatted to PG's standard of 65-70 characters/line.
* _ Read Section 7 of PG's old Volunteers' FAQ at
(https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20191203093834%2Fhttp%3A%2Fdwww.gutenberg.org%2Fwiki%2FCategory%3AFAQ&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259637348%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bnP9x0FugiJkYWJYLd1TmZoPFblVlrPg9bFbWzrPtmc%3D&reserved=0).  Much of the FAQ is somewhat outdated, but Section 7 gives considerable information on PG's standards and expectations for text files.

Another three are Gutcheck (flags common OCR errors), Jeebies (flags he/be errors), and Gutspell (a spell checker).  They can be downloaded from https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pglaf.org%2F~ajhaines%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259660079%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9gI2yYHXRFd0B0Hp4ooIpifaGI2Ffupp%2BeopjTIgi1c%3D&reserved=0.  (Right-click and choose Save Link As.) They work on text files only, and are command-line utilities (no graphic interface).  I've attached a how-to text file describing their use.  Note that they're advisory, not definitive--just because they flag something doesn't mean that something is actually wrong.  The source scans are the authority.
* _x wrongspaced quotes
* _x line-end hyphens (not allowed in PG's text files)
* _x spaced punctuation
* _x inconsistent emdashes (you've used a mix of two and three hyphens.  PG's standard is two for a normal emdash; four for a long-emdash).
* _ Resubmit, mentioning in the upload form's Notes to Whitewashers field that it's for Al Haines attention.
