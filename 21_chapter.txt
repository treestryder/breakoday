CHAPTER XXI.

CONTROVERSY AND REMINISCENCE.

The affair at Break o'Day caused more excitement
than the murder of Green, and was the most notable event
which had happened in the vicinity that season.
Representatives of the Jackson and Ann Arbor Press visited
the hamlet, which in a few weeks acquired more
reputation than it had hitherto gained in half a century.
From Wingscheut a reporter obtained a sensational and
valuable budget of news. His paper stated that the valiant
German had been fated singularly often to meet the
horse-thieves, that in the spring he had an encounter
with them when they were escaping with a horse at the
barn of a farmer named Spartus, that in the swamp near
Break o'Day he maintained, unarmed and unaided, a
combat with four of them, and that, had he been properly
supported, the entire gang might have been captured.

The Jackson "Goad," a sheet published with the avowed
purpose of prodding beyond endurance the party then in
power, was especially active in making inquiries about
Wrengell. It gave a highly colored account of the young
man's sojourn at Ratke's. It dwelt minutely on his
reticence respecting his former residence and occupation.
It declared that a man unused to deeds of violence
could never show such nerve and determination as he had
manifested. It related how he had been detained by the
order-loving citizens of Break o'Day, how he had broken
loose from their restraint, knocking them right and left,
how he had fearlessly charged upon and driven back a
group of men at the dock, how he had sought an
encounter with the boats and had done some phenomenally
close shooting at Long range.

The major was wroth at the wrong done his hired man.
He visited Rorus and talked to him with such sternness
that the doctor did not as usual reply in a long series of
co-ordinate terms capped by an anti-climax. He told him
that he should hold him responsible for the injury which
Wrengell received, and that if one of his men ever again
was subjected to so much as an affront at the drug-store,
he would administer a personal castigation to its proprietor.
Directly after the appearance of the exaggerated article in
the "Goad" Ratke called on the editor and demanded that
retraction be made at once. The next week the story
was modified; but after it was shorn of its absolute
untruths, it still bore strong testimony against Wrengell.

The startling occurrences which agitated Ratke's
neighbors did not keep him from the contemplation of his
inventions. He had engaged an Oakville blacksmith to
iron his Jerusalem wagon, which he decided to take in
pieces and put on another vehicle for transportation. As
the several parts were too heavy to be lifted easily by one
man, he ordered Jake to assist him.

"I expect to create a sensation with my wagon in a few
weeks, Jake," said the philosopher. "If it becomes
famous, you can boast that you had a hand in preparing
the first perfect model."

"Put this 'ere rattletrap in the hind end?" asked Jake,
as he picked up a pair of wheel-posts, seemingly
unconscious of his honorable function.

"Now, Jake," said the major, when he was ready to
start to Oakville, "you may haul the wood which you and
John sawed. I would like to be able to say that my
inventions are used to a great extent on my farm. You may
draw the wood with the Old Jerusalem. I intend to go
to Jackson, and shall no doubt be gone until five o'clock."

Jake had a special aversion to the products of his
employer's genius. With rebellion in his heart he hitched a
team to the Old Jerusalem. He had driven but a few
rods when the reach came unfastened and letting one end
of the box fall to the ground, slid him speedily down the
smooth bottom boards. Many minutes were occupied in
readjusting the detached parts. Impatient of delay, he
climbed on the wagon and spoke sharply to the team, but
the tongue with the whiffletrees was jerked loose, and he
was nearly pulled from his position by the lines. The last
accident intensified his disgust, which he had before
restrained with difficulty. He hitched the horses to a
pair of trucks, and with this equipment hauled the wood in
the forenoon some hours sooner than the major thought
the work would be completed.

Ratke, who drove no farther than Oakville, returned to
the farm at eleven o'clock. After caring for his team, he
went to the field where Montcalm was at work.

"Trace," said the major, "that article which you sent
to the Indianapolis "Standard" will greatly benefit me.
You described my wagon in fine terms. You could never
I have obtained its insertion if you had not once been a
reporter for the paper. Such an account coming from a
distance will make me and my inventions respected more
at home. A great name, to be acquired in one's own
neighborhood, must be imported. We may call this the
endosmose of reputation."

In passing the barns Ratke noticed that the trucks
were not in their accustomed place under a shed. His
anger was kindled at sight of Jake, who was throwing off
his last load of wood from another vehicle than the Old
Jerusalem.

"Jake," said the displeased inventor, hurrying to the
wood-pile, "I told you expressly to use the Old Jerusalem.
Why did you take the trucks?"

"'Cause," replied Sheppard, "I wanted to git done
some time to-day. I didn't like to fuss."

"I pay you for your time," returned Ratke. "When
you do as I tell you, it is my lookout if your service is
unprofitable. After this you use the tool I give you to work
with."

"I don't like no such 'rangement as the Jerus'lem,"
rejoined Jake. "The ole thingumbob ain't good for
nothin', an' never was."

"Jake," said the major, "it is not your place to question
the wisdom of my plans. I am quite capable of directing
my own affairs. VVhenever you are unwilling to obey my
instructions you may quit my employ."

"I guess I better quit now," said Jake. "We never
had no words till to-day, an' we never want none."

"How much do I owe you?" inquired the major.

"You ain't paid me nothin' for two years," answered
Sheppard, "an' there's some back that I earnt afore
that."

"Is that so?" ejaculated the major, ashamed that he
was unable to pay his discharged hired man. "I will get
it for you as soon as I can, Jake."

"They gener'ly make reckonin' on payin' a man when
they ship him," said Jake, "but you needn't be in no hurry
about it. I'll let you know when I want it."

"Never mind throwing off the wood," said the major.
"Come in to dinner. I will have Mark take care of the
team."

"I'm much obliged," returned Jake. "I'll take care of
'em myself and finish up my job at the wood. I don't care
for no dinner. I've et in that house for nine years, but
'tain't likely I'll ever eat there agin."

The major found visitors awaiting him in the house,
Senator Mallard and Mrs. Baldwin, a sister of the statesman's
deceased wife. Mallard's whole aspect was one of
strength, both physical and mental. He was heavily built,
though not corpulent. His face was smooth-shaven.
His mouth was peculiarly expressive, indicating according
to his mood, pleasure, approbation, sarcasm, disdain
or wrath. His eyes were large and dark, and over them
rose a brow which was broad and steep. While he was
yet a young man, he had been prominent in state politics.
Very soon after he had entered the United States Senate,
he was ranked as a power in debate; and in a few years
he was a recognized party leader. The idol of his friends,
he was hated by many of his opponents whose opinions
had been roughly handled by his aggressive speeches.

The greeting between the old men was cordial. They
had many questions to ask, answers to return and experiences
to relate. Since their last meeting one had increased
in wealth and influence, one had virtually lost his property,
each had been bereft of a wife, and each had grown gray,
though he had retained his bodily vigor. Mrs. Grippin
had to repeat her summons to dinner several times before
it was responded to by the major and his guest. Ratke
quite forgot everything except his friend and the scenes
through which they had mutually passed. He talked with
such abstraction, as he waited on the visitors, that he was
unfitted for his duty. He placed potatoes on the plate
intended for Mrs. Baldwin, one at about every four words.
He had the dish well rounded when he was stopped by
Mrs. Grippin, and the second interference of his sister
alone saved the vegetables from being deluged with a
profuse quantity of gravy. After dinner he and Mallard
went back of the house, where they seated themselves on
the wood-pile and talked for half the afternoon.

"Weil, George," said the major, "I suppose you are
confident of being re-elected in January."

"I am confident that I shall not again be re-elected,"
replied Mallard. "For nearly forty years, with scarcely an
intermission I have been a public servant. Now I have a
right to demand that my condition shall be changed from
serfdom to independence."

"There are many who aspire to be tied with the bonds
of national servitude," said the major. "The official has
too much authority properly to be called a slave. He
dictates to those whom you term his masters."

"Neither all nor the greater part of political power,"
returned Mallard, "is wielded by officials acting in an
official capacity. Behind the officer is the will of the
public, and behind that is the moulding influence of the
Press and of those thinkers who study and expound
matters of government. When the honest legislator
finds that his conscience and popular sentiment are
antagonistic, it is his duty to yield to the former; but be who
habitually disregards the wishes of his constituents will
soon destroy his political career."

"The responsibility to constituents," said Ratke, "is
our great safeguard against usurpation. Were it not for
that, the Republican party would be wholly unscrupulous
in its disregard of precedent. The organization of which
you are a leader has repeatedly violated the constitution
and is advocating principles which, if carried out, will
eventually lead to monarchy."

This provoked a spirited reply from Mallard, which in
turn elicited a long answer from Ratke.

"James," called Mrs Grippin, "I'll have to have some
wood now."

"All right, Maria," said the major. "There is no
warrant in the constitution for such dictatorial laws as
have been enacted. Quote, if you can, a single passage
which justifies them."

"Very well," answered Mallard, 'Congress shall have
power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper
for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all
other powers vested by this constitution in the government
of the United States, or in any department or officer
thereof.' The specification in an instrument like the
constitution of every power of a legislative body is quite
impracticable, on account of the limited space in the
instrument and the inability of its framers to tell with any
certainty what exigencies may arise. This provision, had it
not been inserted, would have to be assumed, for no
government could long prosper without the ability to
enact special laws."

"James," said Mrs. Grippin, who was kept by the
presence of her visitors from an outburst of passion, "I'm
waiting for that wood."

"You shall have it," answered Ratke, methodically
picking up two sticks and advancing to the kitchen, 'To
make all laws which shall be necessary and proper.' The
Republican party ignores that word proper. It interprets
the clause thus! 'To make such laws as best serve our
partisan purposes,' An undue concentration of national
authority," he continued, elevating his voice as he entered
the kitchen, "is incompatible with good government.
There should be a diffusion of power."

"Oh, dear! What a man!" exclaimed Mrs. Grippin.
"Two sticks of wood to do a baking. Now you go right
back and get me some wood."

"I can carry the larger load," said Mallard, laughing, as
Ratke descended the back steps. "In our younger days
we tried feats of strength, but I am not used to them
now."

Each man took in a huge armful of wood, and Mrs.
Grippin was satisfied both with the quality and quantity
of the supply. The housekeeper took pains to find several
tasks for her brother, that the discussion might be, broken
off and he might not be worsted by Mallard, for, though
she professed great dislike of his argumentative habits,
she was secretly proude of his proficiency.

"George," said the major, when they had left the house,
"a great career is sometimes late in its commencement,
is it not?"

"Certainly," responded Mallard, "history furnishes
many such instances."

"I believe," said Ratke, "that mine is about to begin.
Did I tell you that I have turned a part of my attention
to literature?"

"No, indeed," answered the senator with some surprise.
"Which one of the muses has captivated you? Are
you pondering over the massive tomes of Themis, are you
under the spell of Polyhymnia's rhetoric, or are you following
the voice of Calliope as she leads you over fields,
through forests and accross lakes, by ancient earth works
and mounds, in which are the relics of extinct races. This
locality, I think, would furnish to a string imagination
material for a grand epic."

"Your guess is incorrect," said Ratke. "The title of
the work which I am writing is 'Nature Concordia
Philospiae  Animi.' In two volumes I am undertaking to
prove that every phenomenon of nature has a corresponding
one in the human mind or soul. Volume one treats
of the relativity of physics and metaphysics, volume two,
of the relation of physical laws to the will and higher
emotions. The moral treatise I finished first, more than
a year ago, in fact.

"In its preparation I was obliged to refer to no modern
language except our own. English is rich in dissertations
of the soul, but it furnishes little to the science of mental
phenomena. In order to master the metaphysical part I
was obliged to read a great deal in German. You know I
am deficient in that language. I was helped in my reading
by Manie and by Wrengell, the young fellow who made
such a stir at Break o' Day."

That night the old men sat up until after twelve o' clock
talking of experiences which stretched through fifty years,
of college days, of books which were but half remembered,
of sports long unpracticed, but still unforgotton, of
acquaintances, some of whom were living, some dead, some
honored, some disgraced. Their faces kindled with
fervor of youth, their tones and gestures were animated;
they were no longer old. They laughed at ludicrous
circumstances with greater zest than when they witnessed the
incidents. Unrealized ambitions, triumphs in the lyceum
and in class-room, petty dessensions with their fellows, they
reviewed with minuteness which they could not have used
in describing later events. At every visit since their
graduation, they had gone over these same experiences. Each
recital had exceeded its predecessor in the pleasure which
it had imparted and the earnestness with which it had been
delivered. Only three days before, Mallard had made in
Chicago a great speech, which was destined to be published
in the papers throughout the entire country and to be
repeated in substance on the platform by the minor
satellites of his party. Now his dignity was laid aside, he
was mirthful, even boyish, in his actions.

"George," said Ratke, "you remember that we confided
our aspirations to each other. Mine have promised
much, but yielded nothing. You have accomplished
what you set out to accomplish. You must be a happy
man."

"You judge too hastily," returned Mallard. "I have
money, I have a fair reputation, but I have
been unfortunate in my family affairs. I had a wife, a
perfect companion, one of the best helpmeets whom God
ever gave to man. She is dead. I had a son, gifted and
promising. I kept him at school and gave him every
advantage. He excelled in his studies. He had a
special liking for rhetoric and argument. I meant to train
him to be a statesman. I believed that he would exceed
me in fame and power as Alexander exceeded Philip.
But he took to drink. He died a disgraceful death, and
the world knows my shame. I had a daughter who was
as amiable as she was beautiful and accomplished. After
the death of my wife and son, she was my idol. For a year
she took music lessons at Detroit. When she came home,
she told me about some attentions which had been paid
her by a young foreiner, a German. I cautioned her to
accept no more of his addresses until I had seen him.
One day I was discussing the slavery question with some
gentlemen in a hotel. You know before the war I was
not in favor of immediate abolition, I was advocating the
principles of the Republican party, when a young abolitionist
commenced to talk in the most fanatical manner. I
answered him, and he returned a torrent of abuse. Saying
that I had no wish to discuss a question with one who
substituted invective for argument, I left him. A few
days after this occurrence I opened the door of my house
and found in the parlor the young man who had treated me
so rudely in the hotel. I bade him go and never enter my
dwelling again. I asked Eliza if this impudent German
was her suitor. She said he was. I told her to hold no
communication with him, that if she did, she could no
longer stay under the protection of my roof. A week
after that they eloped. I made no attempt to follow them,
but Eliza wrote me that they had gone to Detroit, and the
newspapers, of course, tracked them up and put in every
mouth the story of my new disgrace. I would have
welcomed them back had it not been for my positive declaration
that I would not do so. I heard nothing more of
them until my sister-in-law found an item in a paper
which stated that they had been killed two months previously
in a railroad accident at Chicago. An enterprising reporter
had had his attention riveted by the names of
the victims, as they appeared in an old paper and had dis-
covered that they were the same which had been borne
by my son-in-law and daughter. The surmise of the reporter
was correct. I took up the bodies, which are now
in the Lansing cemetery. Never measure happiness by
fame or apparent success."

The next morning the major to no avail urged his
guests to prolong their visit. He did, however, extract a
promise that Mallard would make a more extended stay
the succeeding summer. As the senator and Mrs, Baldwin
were at the gate taking leave of the Ratkes, Panicky
came trudging up with his satchels.

"Good morning, Senator," was the peddler's familiar
salutation. "How do you come on?"

"Very well," answered Mallard. "How is your health,
Mr. Dabney?"

"Extra," said Panicky. "I am exposed enough to kill
three common men, but I know what to take to keep me
healthy. What's the reason I can't ride with you?"

"You can as well as not," replied Mallard, "if you can
sit in the back of the buggy and let your feet hang behind.
It is an uncomfortable way of riding, but it is the best I
can provide for you, Mr. Dabney."

"James," said the senator, "we are old men. We can
not tell when we shall next meet. It may be in another
world."

"I hope you will come back again soon," said Ratke
as they shook hands at parting. "If you do not of your
own accord, I hope circumstances will bring you back."

"I wish I had such a team as that," remarked Panicky,
when they were on their way. "I wouldn't be ramping
through the country as I am now. I know what to give
'em to keep 'em in good trim."

"You sold me some panacea for them, Dabney," said
Mallard with a smile. "I have at home all the medicine
I can possibly use."

"You hauled 'em over the coals good at Chicago," said
Panicky. "That speeche ought to be in the house of every
Republican, and every Democrat, for that matter. If If
could hear you get off the same thing at Lansing, I'd give
all there is in my satchels to some hospital. The Democratic
papers make as big a fuss about that as the doctors
do about the Great American Panacea."

"Why did you not stop at Ratke's?" inquired the
senator. "I should think you would try to make a sale
at every house."

"Oh, yes, I do," said Panicky, "but I was over this
road just a little while ago. I'm going to turn off up hovered
past Takum's. I don't have to peddle the panacea much.
It sells itself."

Mallard's team was young and spirited. Constantly on
the alert for objects by which they might be frightened,
the horses lifted their heads high and drew the buggy
along at a sharp pace. In the road near Takum's house
were playing some children, some of whom were so nearly
of a size that there was no perceptible difference in their
ages. They were seated, or squatted, exactly in the track,
and they moved aside reluctantly to make way for the
travelers. One little girl, who used her apron as a
receptacle of sand, pulled the garment over her face and
suddenly rising, jerked it down, throwing a cloud of dust
almost against the fractious team. The horses jumped
forward, determined to flee from the unwonted spectacle.
They were in a fair way to be quieted when the whole
troop of Takum's dogs, large and small, came bounding
toward them with yelps and barks. They still would have
been manageable by Mallard's strong arm had not accident
aided them in their insubordination. The left-line
snapped in twain, the unbalanced right pulled them to one
side, a front wheel struck a large stone, and the buggy
was overturned.

Panicky was whirled over in a summersault, his satchels,
bumping and jingling, rolled down an incline, where one
of them flew open; his knee struck a small stump which
was inconveniently near. He groaned dismally for a moment;
then, raising himself, began to wail: "Oh, dear!
Oh, gosh! Oh, Jerusha! Oh, I'm dying! I'm dying!
I'm dying!"

Mrs, Baldwin was unhurt. She turned at once to the
assistance of her brother-in-law, whose form was stretched
at full length, motionless and apparently lifeless. She
lifted his head, she rubbed his hands, she called his name.
His closed eyes did not open, he gave no sign of realizing
her attentions. The Ratke family and Brown ran as soon
as possible to the scene of the accident, Nora in advance
of them all. They carried the senseless statesman back
to the house which he had thought he might not again
visit.

Bitterly did Ratke regret his expressed wish that, with
or against his will. Mallard would soon return. The
stalwart frame, the hands he had pressed in farewell, the
features, the changes of which he had watched in controversy
and shared in the revival of memories had, indeed,
come back; but tied in the bonds of inertness, they could
not return his words or feelings. He found, however, that
his friend was not dead. In the course of an hour he had
the satisfaction of seeing him sit up and of hearing him
announce that he felt better.

Daggett was in the tamaracks by the road cutting poles
when his attention was drawn by the sound of rapidly
approaching hoofs. Dropping his ax, he rushed to the,
highway just in time to catch the runaway team. With some
trouble he allayed their excitement and drove them back
toward Ratke's. The overturned buggy and the groaning
peddler were sufficient to explain the catastrophe.

"Helloa! What's up?" he exclaimed, as he neared
Panicky, who was seated on the ground, holding his knee
and rocking back and forth.

"Oh, I'm about dead!" moaned Panicky. "I'm fixed!
My leg's broke! I know it is! Oh, that's awful! You
don't know how I suffer! Oh, I'm laid up for life! Oh,
I won't do another tap of work for six months!"

"I am agent for the Great American Panacea," said Daggett,
advancing with a broken bottle, which had been left
with the fractured part upward, so that it still retained a
portion of its contents. "This medicine is compounded of pine,
hemlock, tamarack, cedar and spruce, besides sovereign
roots and herbs known to the medical fraternity. It cures
cuts, bruises, sprains, wounds, incisions and all injuries to
the flesh. It is also a sovereign remedy for asthma,
bronchitis, tonsilitis, laryngitis and all throat diseases,
besides being an excellent tonic for consumption, dyspepsia,
liver-complaint, rheumatism, malaria, fever and
ague"

"If your knee was like mine, you wouldn't make fun
of it," returned Panicky. "Oh, the whole top of my
knee's smashed! Oh, I won't do another tap of work for
two months!"

"Oh, yes, you will," assured Daggett, "I'll have you
on your feet in no time, I know a fellow over in Ingham,
a log rolled over his leg, smashed the whole business fine,
bones, skin, flesh and all. The doctor, he come
to amputate it, but I got him to try a bottle of the panacea.
Well, the next week was the Fourth of July, and he
took the first prize for running at Lansing, and just a
little while afterward he beat the best mile record by three
seconds. Have a bottle, Mister. It isn't panicky. Paicea,
sir, panacea. Panicky is where they get in a battle,
you know."

"I guess I will rub some of the panacea on my knee,
said the peddier, taking the broken bottle with a grin.
"That feels a good deal better," he acknowledged, as he
arose after applying his medicine. "It beats all how
quickly it helps it," he said, limping to his satchels and
beginning to gather up the uninjured portion of his wares.
"You'll know just what to do for lameness," he concluded,
when with the strap over his shoulder connecting the two
burdens, he was limping around the corner.

Before the arrival of doctor Rorus, for whom the major
had sent. Mallard declared that he was able to recommence
his journey. Ratke protested, but to no avail.
He did, however, induce the senator to take the cars at
Barton Junction and allow Daggett, whom he considered a
fair horseman, to drive the team to Lansing.
