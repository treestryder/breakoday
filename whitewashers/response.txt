Hello, Nathan,

Thank you for this submission.  I'm not familiar with your name, so I assume that this is your first submission to Project Gutenberg?

There are a number of issues with it, in no particular order:

Your detailed Transcriber's Note might be better located at the end of the text/HTML files.

The Google material should be removed--it's not needed (or wanted) in PG's files.  (The URL from which you downloaded the source scans/files should have been entered in the copyright clearance form's Scans Archive field.)

You didn't enter a Credit line in the upload form's Credit field.  A typical entry would be something like "Nathan Hartley from scans obtained from the Internet Archive".  Distributed Proofreaders includes this in their Credit line: "(This file was produced from images generously made available by the Internet Archive".  (PG's posting software prefixes "Thanks to" to whatever's in the field.

Your cover, at over 11M, is far too large, file-size-wise.  Experimentally, I used Irfanview (https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irfanview.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259618302%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fm5XroLVRnM99%2Bq%2BkSFKr5xsrqVpYL7%2F5%2B3z4qxfMUk%3D&reserved=0) to reduce it to 30% of its original size (no other changes), reducing the file size from 11M to approximately 772K.

Your text file isn't properly formatted to PG's standard of 65-70 characters/line.

You should read Section 7 of PG's old Volunteers' FAQ at
(https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20191203093834%2Fhttp%3A%2Fwww.gutenberg.org%2Fwiki%2FCategory%3AFAQ&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259637348%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bnP9x0FugiJkYWJYLd1TmZoPFblVlrPg9bFbWzrPtmc%3D&reserved=0).  Much of the FAQ is somewhat outdated, but Section 7 gives considerable information on PG's standards and expectations for text files.

PG has several utilities for checking text files.  On PG's upload page (https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.pglaf.org%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259649708%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=PsHNGJuyZ4xli81h52Gd4DFrF46uKIumWwONHujcXCk%3D&reserved=0), in the Recommended Additional Checks section, are links to two: pptext and pphtml.  Another three are Gutcheck (flags common OCR errors), Jeebies (flags he/be errors), and Gutspell (a spell checker).  They can be downloaded from https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pglaf.org%2F~ajhaines%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7C1a9a1185c64c4584351508de7433a157%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C639075962259660079%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9gI2yYHXRFd0B0Hp4ooIpifaGI2Ffupp%2BeopjTIgi1c%3D&reserved=0.  (Right-click and choose Save Link As.) They work on text files only, and are command-line utilities (no graphic interface).  I've attached a how-to text file describing their use.  Note that they're advisory, not definitive--just because they flag something doesn't mean that something is actually wrong.  The source scans are the authority.

I've attached their reports on your text file.  They flagged a number of wrongspaced quotes, line-end hyphens (not allowed in PG's text files), spaced punctuation, inconsistent emdashes (you've used a mix of two and three hyphens.  PG's standard is two for a normal emdash; four for a long-emdash).  There's more on these issues in the Volunteers' FAQ.

Many of the above issues will also be in your HTML file.

When you're ready with a revised submission, upload it the usual way, mentioning in the upload form's Notes to Whitewashers field that it's for my attention.  (Do NOT send files as a zipped email attachment.)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this.
