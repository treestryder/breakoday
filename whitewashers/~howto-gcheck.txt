Gutcheck/Jeebies/Gutspell How-To



This article is written for the Windows XP/Windows 7 environment.  
Adapt it as necessary for your particular operating system.  I cannot
speak to its use on Mac computers.



Gutcheck, Jeebies, and Gutspell are invaluable tools for checking
text files in preparation for submission to Project Gutenberg.

They are designed for use on ASCII or ISO-8859 (Latin1) text files.
They do not work on word processor files (doc, rtf, etc.)  File names
must have no spaces in them.


All three are available from http://gutcheck.sourceforge.net/etc.html.

Download them and unzip each of them into its own folder.  

If you're a Windows XP user, a highly recommended adjunct to these 
utilities is the "Open Command Window Here" utility in Microsoft's PowerToy
set of utilities.  If you install it and right-click on a folder
with Windows Explorer, you'll see an "Open Command Window Here" option, 
which if selected, will open a command window at that folder.  (Type 
"exit" and press Enter to close the window.)

Windows 7 has a similar feature--right-clicking on a folder will display
a pop-up menu, one of which is "Open command window here".



There are three general methods, or skill levels, for running all 
three--basic, intermediate, and programmers-only.


Basic Method

To check a text file with all three utilities, copy these files 
into the same folder as the text file:

- gutcheck.exe, gutcheck.typ
- jeebies.exe, be.t2, he.t2
- gutspell.exe, gutspell.dic

Note that none of these utilities will work on files that have spaces in 
their filename, i.e. "my file.txt" won't work, but "myfile.txt" will.  
They also will not work on Unicode files.

If you haven't installed the PowerToy mentioned above, 
open a command window (for Windows XP, Start, Run, type "cmd", 
press Enter), and go to the text file's folder.  (I'm assuming you 
know how to navigate around drives/folders at the command line.  
If not, you'll have to refer to your system's manual, or a 
reference book on your operating system.)

Assuming you're in your text file's folder, enter whichever of these 
commands you need:

gutcheck myfile.txt >gcheck.txt
gutspell myfile.txt >gspell.txt
jeebies myfile.txt >jeeb.txt

Substitute your file's name for "myfile.txt".

The file following the redirect character (>) will contain the report 
generated by each utility.  They're standard text files, readable by any 
text editor, such as Notepad.  They can be any name you wish.  The single 
redirect character causes the report file to be overwritten each time that 
utility is run.

Note that all of these utilities are advisory only--flagged items should be 
checked against the source.



Intermediate Method

The intermediate method assumes you know how to create and run
simple batch files.  If necessary, refer to a reference manual for
your operating system.


This level allows you to run all three utilities without
having to copy them and their support files into your file's working
folder.

Assumptions made in this section--modify them as required for your
environment:

- your working etext files are in c:\myfiles\bookname
- Gutcheck is located in c:\pgms\gutcheck
- Jeebies is located in c:\pgms\jeebies
- Gutspell is located in c:\pgms\gutspell

(c:\pgms\ is the folder I use for non-Windows software.)

Run Notepad (Start, Run, Notepad, Enter) or any text editor.

Enter these lines (but without the line numbers):

1. c:
2. cd c:\pgms\gutcheck
3. gutcheck.exe c:\myfiles\bookname\bookfile.txt > c:\myfiles\bookname\errors.txt
4. cd c:\myfiles\bookname
5. notepad errors.txt

When done, save the file to your book's working folder.  Use any legal
file name, with an extension of ".bat".  Since you'll be running this
filename from the command prompt at least a few times, it's best to
keep the name short.

Line by line:

1. Ensures that you're on the correct drive.  (Optional--not needed if you 
have only a drive C:.)

2. Switches into the folder in which you downloaded and unzipped Gutcheck.

3. Runs Gutcheck on your working file, and sends its results to a file
named "errors.txt".  This file can be named anything you want, 
except that it, obviously, should not be the name of your book's text
file.  It can be erased any time.  It is a standard text file that can 
be opened by Notepad or any text editor.  It will be recreated whenever 
the batch file is run.

4. Switches back to your book's folder.

5. Launches Notepad to display the error file.  


If your working files are on drive D: (or any drive other than C:),
modify the above batch file thusly:

1. c:
2. cd c:\pgms\gutcheck
3. gutcheck.exe d:\myfiles\bookname\bookfile.txt > d:\myfiles\bookname\errors.txt
4. d:
5. cd d:\myfiles\bookname
6. notepad errors.txt


Line 4 - switches back to your working drive.
Line 5 - modified to refer to that working drive.


Run the above batch file from the command window a few times, until
you're satisfied that it works correctly.  After that, you can run
it from Windows Explorer by double-clicking on it.

If you're working on more than one book, create a similar batch 
file in each folder, modifying it as necessary.



Programmers only

If you're a programmer, using the programming environment of your 
choice, you can easily create a shell for Gutcheck, Jeebies, and 
Gutspell.

Whether you work with a single text file for a book, a set of
chapter text files, or a number of page text files, you can
select the files to be checked, and generate and run a batch
file similar to this one:


c:
cd c:\pgms\gutcheck\
del d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutcheck.exe  -u d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P149.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutcheck.exe  -u d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P150.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutcheck.exe  -u d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P151.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutcheck.exe  -u d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P152.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
d:
cd d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North
notepad errors.txt


The first three lines switch to the drive where Gutcheck is
located, switches into its folder, and deletes the existing error
file.

The last three lines switch back to the working drive, into the 
book's working folder, and runs Notepad to display the errors file.

In this particular example, the four lines in between run Gutcheck
on the four files selected in the shell software.  (The -u command
option is discussed in Gutcheck's documentation.)



Here are the equivalent sample batch files for Jeebies and Gutspell,
respectively:

c:
cd c:\pgms\jeebies\
del d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
jeebies.exe  -h d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P149.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
jeebies.exe  -h d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P150.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
jeebies.exe  -h d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P151.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
jeebies.exe  -h d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P152.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
d:
cd d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North
notepad errors.txt



c:
cd c:\pgms\gutspell\
del d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutspell.exe  d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P149.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutspell.exe  d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P150.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutspell.exe  d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P151.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
gutspell.exe  d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\P152.txt >> d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North\errors.txt
d:
cd d:\Data\Books\LeacockS\North
notepad errors.txt
