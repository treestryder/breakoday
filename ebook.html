            This work was scanned and processed with optical character
            recognition (OCR) by Google. However, there was much to
            fix before it could be a proper e-book. For instance, stray
            characters, incorrect characters, hyphens to be removed, entire
            pages missing or gibberish. This repair work was completed and
            the book released through the Gutenberg Project by Nathan Hartley.
            Nathan performed this work in honor of his Great-Great-Great-Grandfather
            George Washington Holland Jr, from whom these stories are believed to
            have originated.></p>

        <p>From "An Account of Ingham County From Its Organization"
            by Frank Turner, George Fuller and Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society.

            "G. W. Holland was historian and poet laureate of Bunkerhill and
            other townships where he resided for forty years. After 1876 he
            became the regular correspondent of the Ingham County Democrat
            and News, the Leslie Local, Stockbridge Sun and Lansing Sentinel.
            He was justice of the peace for twenty-two years, so could write
            from his court docket all kinds of stories. His pen name was
            "Rough and Ready," and he edited a set of stories about White
            Oak and Leroy townships, "Chronicles of Break o'Day." These
            were revised and made into a book by E. Everett Howe that had
            quite a sale. Four editions were published by Robert Smith
            Printing company."

        <p>
            This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library
            shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project to make
            the world's books discoverable online. It has survived long enough for the
            copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain
            book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term
            has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to
            country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a
            wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.
            Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will
            appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the publisher
            to a library and finally to you.

        <p class="center">USAGE GUIDELINES</p>

        <p>
            Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials
            and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the public and
            we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in
            order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to prevent abuse
            by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated
            querying. We also ask that you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use
                by individuals, and we request that you use these files for personal,
                non-commercial purposes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to
                Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine translation, optical
                character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is
                helpful, please contact us. We encourage the use of public domain materials for
                these purposes and may be able to help.
            </li>

            <li>
                Maintain attribution the Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential
                for in forming people about this project and helping them find additional
                materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it.
            </li>

            <li>
                Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for
                ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just because we
                believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the
                work is also in the public domain for users in other countries. Whether a book
                is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer
                guidance on whether any specific use of any specific book is allowed. Please do
                not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used
                in any manner anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liabilities can be
                quite severe.

        <h2>DEDICATION.</h2>

        <p>
            My readers who are familiar with the traditions preserved
            in this history know one woman who is beloved by rich
            and poor, a comforter of the afflicted, a friend of the
            friendless, a mother of the motherless, in prosperity
            without arrogance, in sorrow without complaint. To
            Mrs. Fidelia Gibbins, whose character suggested the
            Mrs. Boyle of my story, this volume is respectfully
            dedicated.

            CHAPTER I.<br>
            <small>A RURAL PHILOSOPHER.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            For a territory containing no high mountain system,
            Michigan has a varied geography. In contrast to the
            sterile hills and grand, pictured rocks of the northern
            peninsula, the productive farms in the southern part of
            the state form an area of fertility unbroken save by a few
            patches of sand and some irregular strips of swamp. The
            largest and most remarkable of these swamps passes from
            north to south through Ingham and Jackson counties,
            extending beyond the borders of Shiawassee and Lenawee.
        </p>

        <p>
            This marshy territory is covered by a motley growth
            of willows, huckleberries, spruce, tamaracks and a few
            pines, in places so thin as to afford no inconvenience to a
            footman, in other places so thick as to be almost inaccessible.
            Horse-thieves, escaped convicts, and deserters from
            the army, have successively sought its seclusion; and
            never has the asylum betrayed the confidence of one who
            trusted in its hospitality.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the western side of the swampy belt lay a farm,
            which, according to the census of 1870, shared, with but
            four others in the State, the distinction of containing one
            thousand acres.
        </p>

        <p>
            The owner of this piece of property for many years was
            Major Ratke, an officer of the Mexican war. He was
            ambitious of acquiring distinction as a philosopher, both
            in his neighborhood and throughout the world. He was
            especially desirous of becoming famous ae a great inventor,
            and to this end he had constructed a large quantity
            of strange machinery. In his inventions he aimed at
            novelty, and so well did he succeed in this respect that
            even his bitterest enemies never accused him of a lack of
            originality.
        </p>

        <p>
            One March morning in 187--, the major was in the sitting-room
            of his gothic house working at an abstruse
            problem in mathematical philosophy, of which he was excessively
            fond. It was hard, however, for him to give it
            his undivided attention. Troubles had been gathering
            about his domain. A mortgage on his estate had been
            foreclosed, and his hired help, never famed for efficient
            service, now shirked duty with even more than their usual
            faithlessness. His widowed sister, Mrs. Grippin, a more
            acute and vigilant overseer than he, had from the chamber
            window repeatedly viewed through a telescope the
            delinquency of two men who were cutting wood on a back
            lot. Her vehement arraignment did not induce the major
            to take action upon the matter, till an event occurred
            which he considered an insult to his dignity as a master.
            He had sent them to the woods with an ax and an
            invention of his own, which he termed a "one-man saw,"
            but which his men called, from the labor of running it, the
            "six-man saw."
        </p>

        <p>
            Next to the "one-man saw" the ax was the tool most
            shunned about the farm. Accordingly, as soon as they
            thought themselves out of sight, the indignant laborers
            took a half-day's vacation to get some tobacco at the village
            of Break o'Day, which circumstance procured their
            immediate discharge.
        </p>

        <p>
            The major had thought it an easy thing to supply
            their places. His surmise, however, was incorrect. Of
            the first three visitors who called at his residence after he
            put up the sign, "Wanted, two hired men," one was a
            lightning-rod man, one was a book agent, and the other a
            tramp, who hired out before breakfast, and after the meal
            declared that it was cold weather to work and that he
            would come around to begin when it got warmer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Notwithstanding the foreclosure of the mortgage the
            major was planning sundry improvements on his place. A
            hill and a quagmire opposite to the house were eyesores
            to his vanity, and he determined to transfer the superfluous
            gravel of the one to the boggy surface of the other.
            His first step was nicely to calculate the expense of the
            undertaking, the only prudence of which he was capable,
            for expense never stood in the way of his projects. When
            he had finished a survey of the hill, he applied his mathematics
            to ascertain its cubical contents, using a confusion
            of geometrical and surveying terms to which Mrs. Grippin,
            though protesting, was obliged to listen.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, as he proceeded in his work, he determined to
            originate a new method for ascertaining the dimensions of
            solid bodies; and his inventive instinct prevailed to such
            an extent that it became greater than his desire to improve
            his farm.
        </p>

        <p>
            He declared that he would invent a system of mathematics
            which should be the basis of calculation for succeeding
            ages. He formed a small earthen mound to
            represent as nearly as possible the shape of the hill. He
            determined to ascertain the weight of the hill by the rule,
            "Similar bodies are to each other as the cubes of their
            like dimensions."
        </p>

        <p>
            As he was giving the miniature mountain a final pat to
            impart additional depth to a depression on its side, his
            sister interrupted his study.
        </p>

        <p>
            "James, there's a man coming."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Strong hand, is he?" asked the major, drawing his
            finger carefully down the mound.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Go and look for yourself," retorted Mrs. Grippin
            tartly." I ain't going to wait on you and let you fool
            with that pile of dirt."
        </p>

        <p>
            "He is as faithful as the day is long," said the major,
            going to the window. "I can tell by his gait. See how
            steadily he walks. He would work at a good jog chopping
            and keep it up all day. He would cut, let me see,
            a quarter of a cord an hour. Eight hours a day. That
            would be two cords."
        </p>

        <p>
            "I'll bet he's the biggest shirk in four counties," commented
            Mrs. Grippin sarcastically. "Anybody can tell
            all about a man by taking him for just the opposite of
            what you say he is."
        </p>

        <p>
            Two nieces of Mrs. Grippin and the major now entered
            from the parlor. The one in advance, Nora Warfle, was
            fair and vivacious, with eyes over which solemnity rarely
            drew a curtain thick enough to hide the merriment
            slumbering within.
        </p>

        <p>
            She was ever on the alert for the ridiculous and the
            mirthful, and in her efforts at diversion she was not always
            scrupulous about wounding the feelings of others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Her companion, Marion Ratke, who resided permanently
            at the farm, was a true representative of her father's
            family. Her height was medium, her form symmetrical,
            and her hair dark brown. She was somewhat handsome,
            though she was too intelligent to be really a beauty.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Here comes a peddler, Manie," whispered Miss
            Warfle excitedly. "Let's buy something of him and beat
            him down on everything he sells."
        </p>

        <p>
            The man had drawn an attention altogether out of proportion
            to the impressiveness of his personal appearance.
            A common observer would at once have decided that he
            had long followed the occupation of peddling. He was
            of ordinary size and wore ordinary clothes. Strapped
            together and hanging, one before his breast and one over
            his back, were two large satchels. They seemed to have
            crowded down his neck and pushed out his chin until his
            shoulders were rounded almost to deformity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first characteristic act which he performed after
            passing through the door was to anticipate the offer of a
            chair by placing himself in one by the fire, as if he had
            done the same thing in the same place a thousand times
            before.
        </p>

        <p>
            "I suppose you've heard the news?" he said, with the
            air of one who holds a secret and who feels his power.
        </p>

        <p>
            "I have heard a great many items of news this winter,"
            answered the major.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Yes, but the news -- the late news. You ain't heard
            about the horse-thieves?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "Horse-thieves?" echoed Miss Warfle. "Are they
            around again? Uncle James, you want to lock your barn
            or they'll be stealing Taylor."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Yes," continued the man, "they've been at it again.
            This time they called on, what's his name? -- this man that
            raises horses over here. Queer I can't think."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Sparks," suggested the major. "Lyman Sparks has
            the best horses of any man in Jefferson township."
        </p>

        <p>
            "No, that ain't his name," answered the man, "it's
            Holmes. That's it, Holmes."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Oh," said the major. "The best horse Holmes has
            will not bring more than $300. Sparks has one for which
            he has been offered $600 -- Madge T., a very good blooded
            animal. He thinks she can outstep my Taylor. He did
            pass me once, but he would not if Taylor had hung to the
            trot."
        </p>

        <p>
            "No wonder he breaks up," put in his sister, "the way
            you train him. Do you know how he does, Nora? He
            trains his team to run. He'll make them stand stock still
            still he yells 'Charge,' and if they don't jump the first
            thing, he thrashes them. Then the next day he'll take Taylor
            out to trot."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Mrs. Grippin!" said the major, his voice sounding an
            octave below his usual speaking key.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Maybe you can get this gentleman to work, Uncle
            James," said Miss Ratke, wishing to put an end to the
            unpleasant controversy.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Well now, like enough," answered the major. "Do
            you want a job?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "I've got one now," said the man, drawing a bottle
            from one of his satchels.
        </p>

        <p>
            "I'm going to do humanity all the good I can, sir, all
            the good I can. I am agent for the Great American
            Panacea. This medicine is compounded of pine, hemlock,
            tamarack, cedar and spruce, besides sovereign roots and
            herbs known to the medical fraternity. It cures cuts,
            bruises, sprains, wounds, incisions, hurts, proud flesh --"
        </p>

        <p>
            "What did you say your panicky is made of?" interrupted
            the fair-haired Miss Warfle.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Panacea, Miss, panacea," corrected the peddler. "It
            cures cuts, bruises, sprains, wounds, incisions and all
            injuries to the flesh. It is also a sovereign remedy for
            asthma, bronchitis, tonsilitis, laryngitis and all throat
            diseases, besides being an excellent tonic for consumption,
            dyspepsia ---"
        </p>

        <p>
            "What is your panicky worth a bottle ?" innocently
            asked Miss Warfle.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Panacea, Miss, panacea," again corrected the medicine
            man. "Panicky is in a battle where the men get in a
            tight place with the rebels coming right onto 'em so they
            have to run, you know. Then when they get whipped and
            can't fight any more, they have what they call a panic, you
            know, or, as you might say, they get panicky. But this is
            a different thing altogether. Better take a bottle. Mister.
            It is a sovereign remedy for asthma, bronchitis, tonsilitis,
            laryngitis "
        </p>

        <p>
            "I would like a good liniment for bruises," said the
            major, "but it is impossible for one remedy to cure so
            many diseases. If it is prepared for everything, it is
            pretty sure to cure nothing."
        </p>

        <p>
            "I ain't so sure about the consumption and the throat
            diseases," said the agent reflectively. "I thought it
            would be good for them on account of its healing proper-
            ties, but it's sure business for bruises."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Have you a good salve?" asked the major.
        </p>

        <p>
            "That's just what I've got," responded the man with
            alacrity, "Derrick's Dough of Life." There's Bill Higgins
            had a colt that got his leg cut on a scythe. Laid it right
            open so the hide was left in flaps. Bill says to me, 'Say,
            Dabney, what'll cure that cut?' and says I, 'I've got the
            very thing for that.' Well, he put on the Dough of Life.
            In two weeks the colt was capering round to beat all. He
            got into the corn, knocked over a fence, chased the cattle
            and sheep, and killed two lambs and kicked the hired man
            on the leg. And I don't know what the hired man would
            have done if it hadn't been for the panacea."
        </p>

        <p>
            When the agent had sold a box of the salve he moved
            toward the back-door and said, "I guess I'll go down
            and try your men. Maybe some of them'll want to buy."
        </p>

        <p>
            "You better wait till noon," said Mrs. Grippin. "Then
            the men won't have to stop work."
        </p>

        <p>
            "They never mind that," said the agent." They was
            always real good about stopping whenever I come around."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Of course they'd be willing to stop and gab with him,"
            commented Mrs. Grippin, looking after the retreating
            agent." James Ratke, if you had the gumption of a man,
            you'd kick such loafers off the farm when they come
            palavering round with an excuse for your lazy hired
            men to stop work."
        </p>

        <p>
            "How did he know I had so many hired men?" asked
            the major.
        </p>

        <p>
            "How did he know?" repeated his sister. "Ain't he
            been here half a dozen times before? He comes about
            every six months, and a nuisance he is, too. Ain't you
            heard them tell about old Panicky? You're the only man
            in the country that don't know him."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Oh, yes," said the major, "I do have some recollection
            of him; but I was away from home when he made his
            last two or three visits."
        </p>

        <p>
            "In the name of mercy," exclaimed Mrs. Grippin, "if
            there ain't another lightning-rod man."
        </p>

        <p>
            The young man coming up the walk might have been
            twenty-eight. The preceding speculation concerning his
            profession seemed correct, for nothing about him indicated
            acquaintance with farm labor. His elegant form, his
            dark hair and eyes and a heavy brown mustache combined
            with an air of easy grace to make him one of those
            so rarely met with whom any apparel becomes. Yet, as
            is usually the case with such individuals, he bestowed
            more care on his personal appearance than he would
            have bestowed had nature made such attention more
            necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The stranger with few preliminaries made an application
            for work. To this proposal Ratke did not immediately
            reply. He gave his own name and requested the young
            man to do likewise.
        </p>

        <p>
            "My name is Montcalm," said the stranger, with a
            smile which at once won the major's heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Montcalm," exclaimed the major; "that is the name
            of one of my comrades in the army."
        </p>

        <p>
            "My father held the rank of captain in the Mexican
            war," said Montcalm. "I am the heir to his given name,
            which was Traceworth."
        </p>

        <p>
            Instantly the major was shaking him by the hand." Is
            he alive? Is he well? Where does he live?" were his
            ejaculations.
        </p>

        <p>
            "He died fifteen years ago," answered Montcalm, "at
            his home in Cortland, New York."
        </p>

        <p>
            "He was a noble fellow," said the major, "and his
            sword was one of the best in the brigade. General Taylor,
            in his official report, made special mention of him for
            bravery in the battle of Resaca de la Palma. I was by
            his side during the engagement, and I, like the rest of the
            men, noticed his impetuosity, though I had little time to
            watch my comrades. It always seemed as if he ought to
            have been promoted, but justice is not in every case meted
            out in this world. Did you ever hear him speak of me?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "I have heard him mention his comrades in the army,
            but I have forgotten their names," answered Montcalm.
            "I was young when he died."
        </p>

        <p>
            "We first got acquainted in the Black-Hawk war," said
            the old man." He was generally good-natured, but he
            had a terrible temper and was very set in his way. I
            have suspected that that was one thing which kept him
            from rising in the service. One night on Wisconsin River,
            after we had been chasing Black-Hawk all day, the
            mosquitos were very thick. Some of the boys rolled and
            tumbled and some swore. As I was exposing first one
            part of my face and then another, to see if there was not
            some place the pests had less relish for, I heard a
            threshing so regular that I knew whoever was making it meant
            to push hostilities to the last, and when I looked, I saw
            Trace sitting up and striking as deliberately as he would
            plan a compaign. But it was a wicked vindictiveness,
            and when the lieutenant laughed at him, he wanted to
            fight.
        </p>

        <p>
            "His set ways came near getting him into trouble once.
            It was at the last battle in the Wisconsin territory. The
            Indians had been beaten and were swimming across a
            slough, bucks, pappooses and squaws all splashing around
            together. We had orders to fire on them from the bank.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Trace told me he thought it was a hard sight, and he
            would fire, but he would take care the bullets did not hit
            anybody. Most of the Indians were shot down before
            they got across. One old buck turned back to help a
            squaw, probably his own, to get her pappoose to shore.
            Trace and I wanted to have that old fellow get clear; but I
            while we were congratulating ourselves that he stood a
            little chance, Ben Rogers, right close by, drew a careful
            bead on him. Now, Ben was the best shot in the regiment,
            and my heart went down in my boot-heels, but
            Trace jostled him just as he fired. Well, Ben was mad.
            He threatened to report, and if he had. Trace might have
            got court-martialed, but he never did. Trace's jostling
            did no good, however. The old buck fell, going over
            the bluff on the other side. How long before dinner,
            Maria?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "About three-quarters of an hour," answered Mrs.
            Grippin with unaccustomed good-nature. "I'll ring the
            bell when it's time, and I ought to have a load of wood,
            James."
        </p>

        <p>
            "All right," responded the major. "Show Trace his
            room. I must call you Trace on your father's account,
            for it is a luxury to address his son as I did him. We
            will make no bargain till after dinner."
        </p>

        <p>
            After bringing in the wood, Ratke waited a few minutes
            for Montcalm's appearance. At the end of that period
            Montcalm came from the bedroom, wearing a suit of plain
            clothes and a pair of stoga boots. Even this dress did
            not give him the air of a farmer, which he had evidently
            sought to assume. His hands, soft and white, indicated
            that he was unacquainted with muscular toil; and his
            whole aspect and demeanor, in ways not easily described,
            pointed to the same conclusion. There was in his address
            something which was peculiarly winning, and which would
            have fascinated Ratke without the assistance of the
            veteran's friendship for his old comrade.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Why, you have made a farmer of yourself," said the
            major. "No, you have only tried to. Well, suppose we
            look around a little before dinner. Go to work now? No,
            sir, not a stroke do you do till one o'clock;" and, leading
            the way, the master of the domain passed out to a survey
            of the farm; but Mrs. Grippin called him back to take
            from her table the pile of dirt intended as the basis of his
            mathematical calculations.

            CHAPTER II.<br>
            <small>THE NEW JERUSALEM.</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Montcalm observed that part of the estate which was
            open to his view. The white wrap of winter was nearly
            worn out, but here and there islands and peninsulas of
            snow glimmered in isolated stations from the somberer
            areas of lately uncovered earth, or stretched away in
            varying and grotesquely formed curves to join the more
            protected strips along the fences. The cultivated land on
            that side of the road was enclosed in semicircular shape,
            and a strip of timber extended from the swamp to a point
            northwest of the house, as if starting out to cut the
            improvements in twain, and afterward repenting of its
            design. At the western end it terminated in a patch of
            shrubs over which could be seen the tops of the statelier
            trees beyond. To the east the hardwood timber, mostly
            of oak, skirted, till it nearly reached the road, along the
            marsh which bordered the great swamp. The only signs
            of vegetable life which were visible to Montcalm were in
            the spruce and pine, which could be distinguished from
            the tamaracks by their evergreen branches.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the major discoursing volubly as they went along,
            the two men passed to the barns. These were three in
            number. The largest, ornamented on the top with three
            cupolas and a prancing horse, was the center from the
            extremities of which branched the others, nearly forming
            a yard, which was completed by a connecting fence.
        </p>

        <p>
            A discourse, which his biographer has not taken the
            trouble to find, was given by the major on the character
            and phrenology of each beast: on the horse which would
            threaten but never kick, on the one which would kick but
            never threaten, on the cow which would jump from good
            to poor pasture for the mere satisfaction of being unruly,
            and on several others which would jump from poor to
            good pasture for obvious reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Here is the finest animal I have," said the major, laying
            his hand on the hip of a horse with a long foretop and
            a fine head and ears. "Zachary Taylor, probably the
            best blooded horse in the county. Taylor went in two
            fifty-nine when he was four, just previous to his purchase
            by me. He ought to beat that by twenty seconds now,
            but I have let Maria and Manie drive him. Next summer
            nobody except myself shall hold a rein over him. Taylor,
            old boy, you want an ear of corn? You have not seen my
            machine shop," said the animated old man, opening the
            door of a building at the west end of the group of barns.
            "Are you interested in machinery?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "I have an interest in progress," answered Montcalm,
            "but little knowledge of mechanics."
        </p>

        <p>
            A practical machinist would have had much difficulty
            in classifying the various specimens of constructive talent
            hanging on the walls and strewn in chaos about the floor.
            Old reapers, clocks, fanning mills and threshing machines
            had been dissected to furnish material for wild inventive
            schemes, more than half of which had been left unfinished.
            A strange looking wagon had in an unusual degree the
            merit of originality. Each wheel, six feet high, revolved
            on a peg set between two upright posts. These posts
            were connected at the top so that the vehicle had no axle-
            tree. Two boxes suspended from the posts, and about
            two and one half feet in height, were joined together by
            an attachment underneath.
        </p>

        <p>
            "A revolution in road vehicles is coming," began the
            major." The days of hard pulling and breaking horses'
            legs by blows from the tongue are almost over. You can
            see at once that this wagon must have a light draught.
            The attachment of the tongue down low lessens the rolling
            friction on the ground, and the six-foot wheel does a
            great deal to lessen the sliding friction on the axle. Let
            me make that plain. The passage of the wheel along the
            ground is called friction, but I question its right to the
            definition. One molecule is planted on the ground and
            rests there until another takes its place, when it rises and
            a second particle becomes the pivotal point, to be succeeded
            by the third, fourth and so on. The only friction
            then is in the adhesion of the surfaces as the upper one
            is planted down and removed; a great difference, you
            observe, from that which comes from passing parallel with
            the surface of a body. But that at the point of the
            revolutionary pivot is different. Here the wheel is continually
            scraping over the axle, a resistance which it requires
            much more force to overcome. A six-foot wheel revolves
            every -- let me see -- every six multiplied by three and one
            thousand and four hundred and sixteen ten-thousandths,"
            and the major began to figure on the wall, "every time it
            goes eighteen and eight thousand four hundred and
            ninety-six ten-thousandth's feet. A four-and-one-half-foot
            wheel revolves, I'll tell you in a moment -- every time it
            goes fourteen and one thousand three hundred and
            seventy-two ten-thousandth's feet. The smaller wheels,
            having a swifter movement at the pivot, occasion a greater
            amount of friction."
        </p>

        <p>
            Montcalm, though tortured by the tedious harangue,
            practiced his well learned art of flattery by attention, and
            tipped his head on one side with an air of gravest concern.
        </p>

        <p>
            "If I had it in shape," pursued the major, "we would
            hitch on and try it, but it is not ironed yet, and it has cost
            me too much labor to use it up recklessly."
        </p>

        <p>
            Montcalm hastened to protest against the sacrifice to
            his curiosity of an invention which had cost so much labor
            of hand and brain. He was anxious, very anxious, to see
            the wagon tested, but he begged the major on no account
            to subject it to a trial until it was properly ironed and
            fitted for running.
        </p>

        <p>
            "I'll tell you what we can do," suggested the major.
            "Get in and let me draw you, and we will try its draught."
        </p>

        <p>
            To this proposal Montcalm objected, but he volunteered
            to act as horse while the major rode. Accordingly the inventor
            seated himself in the product of his genius, which
            Montcalm drew back and forth, praising the lightness of
            its draught and suppressing the grunts whose utterance
            would have belied his statement.
        </p>

        <p>
            When Montcalm's energy began to flag, the major inquired,
            "You do not know the name of the wagon, do you, Trace?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "No, I was wondering about that," answered Montcalm;
            "it seems to me an ancient name would be proper, some
            kind of chariot, -- Pharaoh's chariot for instance."
        </p>

        <p>
            "No," said the major, shaking his head and clambering
            from the vehicle," I call it the New Jerusalem."
        </p>

        <p>
            "What induced you to call it that?" asked Montcalm.
            "Was it the splendor of the ornaments you mean to put
            on or some reason which I do not comprehend?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "Well," answered the major, purposely keeping his
            auditor in suspense," it is a long history. Some years
            ago there was, over across the swamp, an old man by the
            name of Barrow, an out-and-out Adventist. He said the
            world was coming to an end before long. He could not
            tell exactly when, but it could not be longer than '69, and
            he could prove it by the prophecies in fourteen different
            ways. He used to go up and down the road to Break o'Day,
            and to the neighbors' houses, without a hat, always
            with the same strain, 'Babylon is fallen, is fallen.' A
            quarter of the topers and loafers who hung around Rorus's
            drug-store were scared into leaving off an occasional spree,
            and the other three-quarters had some fun repeating his
            prophecies about the restoration of the Jews. One day
            he came bareheaded out to the barn, where my men and I
            were looking over the old wagon, the first one I invented,
            and he began:
        </p>

        <p>
            "'The world's going to burn -- going to burn up, I tell
            you. The time of the Gentiles is fulfilled. Babylon the
            great is fallen, is fallen' (the old man always talked fast),
            'and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of
            every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful
            bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath
            of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
            fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth
            are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
            Come out of her, my people. The Jews are to be gathered
            to Jerusalem.
        </p>

        <p>
            "'When will the great day come? "For the day of vengeance
            is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come.
        </p>

        <p>
            "'"From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
            away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up,
            there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days."
        </p>

        <p>
            '"'That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust
            eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm
            eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the
            caterpillar eaten.'
        </p>

        <p>
            '"'We've had the caterpillar and the grasshopper and the
            potato-bug and the weevil. Describes it exactly.
        </p>

        <p>
            '"'And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay
            desolate in the sight of all that passed by.'
        </p>

        <p>
            "'Jerusalem has been so they couldn't raise a thing there,
            not a thing, and now they're raising wheat. Wheat in
            Jerusalem! They sent a thrashing machine there last year.
        </p>

        <p>
            "'We've got to turn in with the Jews and go to Jerusalem.
            Never mind your wagon, Ratke. You better make a Jerusalem
            wagon.'
        </p>

        <p>
            "Well, the idea struck my men so forcibly that they
            dubbed it the Jerusalem wagon, and the name always stuck
            by it. I like it well enough myself, and so after I made
            the second one, to distinguish between them, I called it
            the New Jerusalem."
        </p>

        <p>
            It is as yet an unsolved problem how long the old man
            would have continued the recital of these reminiscences
            had he not been interrupted by a strange clamor from near
            the house. The noise seemed to be produced by the
            strokes of some metallic object against a steel plate, which
            had a resonance sufficient to make the sound continuous.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Dinner!" exclaimed the major.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the men left the machine shop, the cause of the commotion
            was apparent to Montcalm. Mrs. Grippin, with
            the energy characteristic of all her actions, was using a
            two-foot iron bar to belabor a long upright saw suspended
            from an apple-tree, and that superannuated piece of
            machinery was protesting against the punishment with
            the most doleful lamentations.
        </p>

        <p>
            "You have not expressed your opinion of my bell.
            Trace," said the major.
        </p>

        <p>
            "It has a very powerful voice," commented Montcalm.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Make an estimate of the cost of that bell," said the
            major.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Ten dollars," suggested Montcalm.
        </p>

        <p>
            "No."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Twenty-five dollars."
        </p>

        <p>
            "No."
        </p>

        <p>
            "I give it up," said Montcalm.
        </p>

        <p>
            "I calculate that that bell cost me about ten thousand
            dollars," said the major, watching his companion to note
            the effect of his words.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Indeed!" exclaimed Montcalm, manifesting the proper
            amount of surprise. "How is that?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "That is the old upright saw which used to be in McGraw's
            mill," said the major. "I got it for one dollar,
            and, in less than a month, I had the plan for a drag-saw
            for small logs that was ahead of any invention which had
            been projected up to that date, for it was to take only two
            horses. One day, about noon, I heard a hubbub loud
            enough to wake the nations, and when I got where it was,
            I found Maria pounding the edge of that saw just as she
            is doing now. See how viciously she strikes, as if she
            were bent on destroying the last vestige of its usefulness.
            She had banged the teeth so much that using it afterwards
            was wholly put of the question. I always suspected that
            she did it on purpose to defeat my plan. And she did.
            I turned my attention to the old Jerusalem, and before I
            did anything more with the saw, a Wisconsin lumberman
            had the start of me. If all people were like her, this
            would be an unprogressive world."
        </p>

        <p>
            On entering the house, the veteran found awaiting him
            a visitor, whom Mrs. Grippin introduced as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            "James, here is a man that wants work."
        </p>

        <p>
            The major made mental observations on the capacity
            of the new-comer for labor.
        </p>

        <p>
            The young fellow, who was not more than twenty-two
            years old, gave his name as John Wrengell. His stature
            was above the common height, but his form was not Stocky.
            He had Saxon blue eyes, light brown hair and the sensitive
            nature which accompanies the nervous temperament.
            The evidence of a strong character was visible in his
            well-shaped head, his expressive countenance and his
            intelligent, though embarrassed speech.
        </p>

        <p>
            The introduction to the ladies exhibited a vast difference
            between Montcalm and Wrengell. Montcalm bowed
            with a courtesy which was at once easy and pleasing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wrengell blushed, mispronounced one name, half mumbled
            the other, and in sitting down overturned with a
            backward sweep of his arm the heap of dirt so much
            doted on by the major.
        </p>

        <p>
            Miss Warfle with much difficulty repressed her mirth,
            and the old officer with still more trouble kept back his
            irritation from open expression.
        </p>

        <p>
            "There, James," exclaimed Mrs. Grippin, who arrived
            on the scene just in time to see the sand and gravel
            scattered over the floor." There, I told you you'd have
            that thing tipped over. Can't you bring in dirt enough
            on your boots without lugging it in in a heap to make me
            sweep up?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "I thought," responded the major, "that my model
            hill would keep its line of direction within its base, and that
            its cohesion would not be acted upon by external forces
            sufficiently to destroy it. My clay mound stayed here
            two weeks, and it constantly maintained a preponderance
            of attractive over repulsive forces, but clay possesses
            more viscosity than sand."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Viscosity," repeated Mrs. Grippin in disgust. "Now
            you've got on one of your high-sounding strains. Can't
            you talk so anybody can understand you? Who ever
            heard of viscosity?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "It is a mortifying fact," said the major, putting a degree
            of solemnity into his voice," that I have a sister who
            does not know the meaning of viscosity. It is derived
            from the Latin viscum. Viscum, viscositas; French, viscosite;
            Provencal, viscositat; Spanish, viscosidad; Portuguese, vis---"
        </p>

        <p>
            "'What do we care about your viscos and viscovuses?"
            retorted Mrs. Grippin. "When you talk common English,
            folks give you credit for some sense, but when you
            try to show off so smart, everybody is disgusted with you."
        </p>

        <p>
            The approach of the hired men was now heralded by
            the confused hum of voices, varied now and then by a
            boisterous laugh. When they had taken their turns at
            the wash-dishes, the towel and the looking-glass, they
            passed to the dining-room.
