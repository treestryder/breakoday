1893

[Transcribers's Notes]

Though this book was scanned, then processed with optical character
recognition, by Google, there were many parts of the book that needed
to be cleaned up before it could be a proper e-book. This book has been 
lovingly repaired and released through the Gutenberg Project by
Nathan Hartley in honor of his Great-Great-Great-Grandfather 
George Washington Holland Jr, from whom these stories originate.

From "An Account of Ingham County From Its Organization"
by Frank Turner, George Fuller and Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society.

"G. W. Holland was historian and poet laureate of Bunkerhill and
other townships where he resided for forty years. After 1876 he
became the regular correspondent of the Ingham County Democrat
and News, the Leslie Local, Stockbridge Sun and Lansing Sentinel.
He was justice of the peace for twenty-two years, so could write
from his court docket all kinds of stories. His pen name was
"Rough and Ready," and he edited a set of stories about White
Oak and Leroy townships, "Chronicles of Break o'Day." These
were revised and made into a book by E. Everett Howe that had
quite a sale. Four editions were published by Robert Smith
Printing company."

GOOGLE

This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library
shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project to make
the world's books discoverable online.  It has survived long enough for the
copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain
book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term
has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to
country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a
wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.
Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will
appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the publisher
to a library and finally to you.

we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in
order to keep providing tliis resource, we liave taken steps to prevent abuse
by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated

helpful, please contact us. We encourage the use of public domain materials for

is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer
guidance on whether any specific use of any specific book is allowed. Please do
not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used

DEDICATION.

My readers who are familiar with the traditions preserved
in this history know one woman who is beloved by rich
and poor, a comforter of the afflicted, a friend of the
friendless, a mother of the motherless, in prosperity
without arrogance, in sorrow without complaint. To
Mrs. Fidelia Gibbins, whose character suggested the
Mrs. Boyle of my story, this volume is respectfully dedi-
cated.
